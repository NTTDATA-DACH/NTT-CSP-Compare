        <h1>Cloud Service Provider Comparison</h1>
        <h2>ScaleWay vs StackIT</h2>

        <div class="summary-card">
            <h3>Overarching Summary</h3>
            
            <div><p>The strategic comparison between Scaleway and STACKIT represents a choice between a mature, commercial 'European Hyperscaler' and a specialized 'Sovereign Compliance' provider. Scaleway is the superior choice for 80-90% of business cases, particularly for digital natives and scale-ups. It dominates in Developer Experience (DX), feature velocity (Serverless, AI, Managed Services), and cost-efficiency, often undercutting STACKIT by 3x-4x. Scaleway functions as a cohesive Cloud Platform. STACKIT, conversely, functions as a robust Virtual Data Center. Its primary value proposition lies in the Schwarz Group ecosystem (Retail/Enterprise sovereignty) and specific high-resilience engineering features like Metro Availability Zones (synchronous replication) and Managed Vault. Recommendation: Standardize on Scaleway for agility, innovation, and cost management. Reserve STACKIT exclusively for workloads requiring strict German physical data residency, zero-RPO synchronous storage replication, or integration with the Schwarz retail ecosystem.</p></div>

            <h3>Domain-Specific Summaries</h3>
            
            
            <h4>Compute</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway leads decisively in maturity and value, offering a 'batteries-included' platform with advanced features like Serverless and Apple Silicon at a fraction of the cost. STACKIT is best viewed as a sovereign infrastructure provider; while it offers lower lock-in due to OpenStack standards, it trails significantly in feature velocity and is priced as a premium enterprise tier.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Storage</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway provides the superior general-purpose Object and Archival storage, offering cloud-native features (S3 Object Lock, Lifecycle) at aggressive price points. However, STACKIT holds a critical technical advantage for enterprise resilience with its Metro Availability Zone (synchronous replication) for Block Storage, making it the better choice for mission-critical applications requiring zero data loss during a data center failure.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Networking</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway offers a polished, managed experience with sophisticated Layer 7 Load Balancing and integrated DNS, making it ideal for web applications. STACKIT requires more manual configuration (OpenStack Networking) but offers significant cost advantages for high-bandwidth infrastructure by including NAT and egress traffic for free, whereas Scaleway charges for Gateway throughput.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Container Operations</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway is the preferred platform for modern DevOps, offering a feature-rich Kubernetes engine (multi-cloud control plane, ARM support) and a stable ecosystem. STACKIT provides a functional, compliant utility Kubernetes service and a highly portable Managed Harbor registry, but it lacks the developer-centric tooling and cost optimization of Scaleway.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Databases and Big Data</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway dominates for general-purpose workloads through innovation (Serverless SQL) and highly competitive pricing. STACKIT is the technically superior choice only for specific high-scale enterprise patterns, such as Sharded MongoDB or Data Lakehouse (Dremio) architectures, where Scaleway's vertical-scaling limitations become a bottleneck.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Messaging</h4>
            <div><p>This is STACKIT's strongest technical domain. Its Managed RabbitMQ service offers industry-standard reliability, complex routing, and high throughput. Scaleway's offering is a limited serverless emulation of SQS/SNS with restrictive quotas and lower SLAs, suitable only for simple, sporadic event triggering.</p></div>
            
            <h4>AI Services</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway is a comprehensive AI engineering platform, enabling both model consumption and the deployment of custom fine-tuned models on dedicated hardware. STACKIT is currently limited to a 'Model-as-a-Service' API catalog, making it viable for generic chatbot integration but insufficient for proprietary AI development.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Security and Governance</h4>
            <div><p>The domain is split: STACKIT offers a superior Secrets Management solution by providing Managed HashiCorp Vault (Zero Lock-in). Scaleway, however, leads in Identity and Access Management (IAM) granularity and Audit Trail maturity. Use STACKIT for secret portability and Scaleway for fine-grained access control.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Monitoring</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway offers a mature, production-ready observability suite that is cost-effective and supports data export. STACKIT's monitoring stack is currently in a risky state (Preview status, no telemetry backups, no data export), making it unsuitable for mission-critical historical analysis.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Edge and IoT</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway provides a mature, integrated, and highly affordable Edge/CDN portfolio. STACKIT's offering is nascent and lacks the operational history and feature depth required for modern content delivery.</p></div>

They publish transparency reports and state they do not respond to foreign warrants without an MLAT. However, their reliance on US-based sub-processors for critical functions (see SOV-06) such as <strong>Zendesk</strong> (ticketing) and <strong>Aircall</strong> (telephony) creates a vector where customer metadata (support tickets, contact details) could theoretically be subject to extraterritorial access orders served to those US vendors.</p>

Its <strong>Dev1</strong> and <strong>General Purpose</strong> instances are often priced at a fraction of the cost of traditional enterprise clouds. For example, a comparable 4GB RAM instance can cost roughly <strong>€14/month on Scaleway</strong> versus nearly <strong>€44/month on STACKIT</strong>.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong> (part of the Schwarz Group) positions itself as a premium, sovereign European cloud alternative to AWS and Azure. While its pricing is competitive against US hyperscalers and includes the significant benefit of <strong>free egress traffic</strong>, it cannot compete with Scaleway on raw compute value. STACKIT's premium is justified for enterprises requiring strict German data residency and compliance, but for a typical startup looking for value-for-money infrastructure, the cost disparity is massive.</p> <ul><li><strong>Billing Granularity:</strong> Both use hourly billing, though Scaleway enforces a 60-minute minimum charge.</li><li><strong>Egress Fees:</strong> Both providers excel here, offering free or virtually unlimited bandwidth, eliminating the 'bandwidth tax' common with AWS/GCP.</li><li><strong>Verdict:</strong> Scaleway is the superior choice for cost-conscious users, whereas STACKIT serves a specific enterprise compliance niche at a higher price point.</li></ul>

Its <strong>Dev1</strong> and <strong>General Purpose</strong> instances are often priced at a fraction of the cost of traditional enterprise clouds. For example, a comparable 4GB RAM instance can cost roughly <strong>€14/month on Scaleway</strong> versus nearly <strong>€44/month on STACKIT</strong>.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong> (part of the Schwarz Group) positions itself as a premium, sovereign European cloud alternative to AWS and Azure. While its pricing is competitive against US hyperscalers and includes the significant benefit of <strong>free egress traffic</strong>, it cannot compete with Scaleway on raw compute value. STACKIT's premium is justified for enterprises requiring strict German data residency and compliance, but for a typical startup looking for value-for-money infrastructure, the cost disparity is massive.</p> <ul><li><strong>Billing Granularity:</strong> Both use hourly billing, though Scaleway enforces a 60-minute minimum charge.</li><li><strong>Egress Fees:</strong> Both providers excel here, offering free or virtually unlimited bandwidth, eliminating the 'bandwidth tax' common with AWS/GCP.</li><li><strong>Verdict:</strong> Scaleway is the superior choice for cost-conscious users, whereas STACKIT serves a specific enterprise compliance niche at a higher price point.</li></ul>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Object Storage (Service A)</strong> represents a mature, cloud-native storage product that competes directly with hyperscalers in terms of feature integration. Its ability to handle lifecycle transitions (Hot &rarr; Cold/Glacier) within a single bucket and apply granular S3 Object Lock policies makes it highly versatile for modern application development. The transition to a custom 'Hive' backend demonstrates a commitment to performance optimization beyond off-the-shelf open-source implementations.</p><p><strong>STACKIT Object Storage (Service B)</strong> is a robust, compliance-first offering but feels technologically conservative. It appears to rely on a standard Ceph/OpenStack implementation, which is reliable but lacks the advanced 'managed service' polish of Scaleway. The separation of 'Object Storage' and 'Archiving Service' into distinct product lines (or requiring distinct configuration overhead) contrasts with the seamless tiering available in Scaleway. Furthermore, Scaleway's explicit Multi-AZ SLA (99.9%) and wider regional footprint give it a tangible edge for general-purpose cloud workloads.</p><p>The score of <strong>-3</strong> reflects that while STACKIT is functional and stable (not 'Critically Flawed'), it is <strong>Noticeably Inferior</strong> in developer experience (DX) and feature consolidation compared to Scaleway's more refined offering.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p>Both services are fundamentally <strong>S3 Compatible</strong>. Scaleway exposes an S3 API over its custom backend, while STACKIT exposes an S3 API (likely via Ceph RGW). Migrating data out of either service involves standard S3 tools (Rclone, AWS CLI) and bandwidth costs, with no proprietary data formats or unique API calls required for basic operations. Since the interface is identical (RESTful S3) and neither vendor forces a proprietary SDK, the lock-in risk is symmetrical and minimal.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for typical startup workloads, offering a highly aggressive price point and a generous permanent free tier. Its storage costs are approximately <strong>45-50% lower</strong> than STACKIT's for comparable Multi-AZ resilience. Specifically, Scaleway charges roughly <strong>€0.0146/GB</strong> for Multi-AZ storage, whereas STACKIT charges approximately <strong>€0.027/GB</strong> (calculated from hourly rates). Scaleway also offers a Single-AZ tier at ~€0.0075/GB, further widening the gap for non-critical data.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong> distinguishes itself with a <strong>free egress</strong> policy (based on recent data), which makes it financially attractive for specific use cases where data transfer volume significantly exceeds storage volume (e.g., >120% monthly turnover). However, for standard storage, backup, or asset hosting where the data sits longer than it is moved, the higher storage premiums make it more expensive.</p> <p>For a startup, Scaleway's <strong>75 GB free tier</strong> covers early-stage needs entirely for free, whereas STACKIT would incur costs from the first byte after the trial period.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p>This comparison represents a clash between two fundamentally different architectural approaches: <strong>IaaS Primitive (Scaleway)</strong> vs. <strong>Compliance SaaS (STACKIT)</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Scaleway Glacier</strong> is a traditional 'Cold Storage' implementations. It behaves exactly as a cloud architect expects: you transition objects via S3 Lifecycle rules, they become inaccessible, and restoring them requires a 'thaw' request that takes 24 to 48 hours (or longer, as per user reports of up to 80 hours). Its primary strength is <strong>Standardization</strong>. Because it uses the S3 API, it integrates effortlessly with the entire modern DevOps stack.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT Archiving</strong>, conversely, is <em>not</em> a standard cold storage bucket. It is a specialized compliance vault. Its killer feature is <strong>Instant Retrieval</strong>; unlike Scaleway, there is no waiting period to access archived data. However, this comes at the cost of <strong>Versatility</strong>. It does not use the S3 API. Instead, it relies on proprietary REST endpoints or legacy SAP interfaces. For a generalist developer, this is a major regression in User Experience (UX), requiring custom SDK implementation rather than simply pointing an existing S3 client at a new endpoint.</p> <p>The score of <strong>0 (Parity)</strong> reflects this trade-off: STACKIT is technically superior in performance (instant access) and compliance rigor (hardware WORM), but Scaleway is technically superior in interoperability and ecosystem support.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Critical Discrepancy:</strong> Scaleway uses the industry-standard <strong>S3 API</strong>. Data stored in Scaleway Glacier can be migrated to AWS, Wasabi, or MinIO with minimal code changes (often just changing the endpoint URL). It scores a near-perfect +10 for portability.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT Archiving</strong> creates extreme vendor lock-in. It uses a <strong>Proprietary REST API</strong> and SAP-specific protocols. Data ingested into STACKIT Archiving cannot be simply 'synced' to another provider using tools like <code>rclone</code>. Migrating away would require building a custom extraction tool to read from their proprietary API and write to a standard target. While STACKIT offers a separate 'Object Storage' service that <em>is</em> S3-compatible, the specific 'Archiving Service' requested is a walled garden.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Glacier</strong> is the clear winner for cost-driven archival strategies, offering a price point (~€0.002/GB/month) that is effectively one of the lowest in the European market. It includes a generous <strong>75 GB free egress allowance</strong> monthly, which is rare for cold storage where retrieval costs usually sting. While they have introduced retrieval fees (~€0.009/GB), the total cost of ownership remains minimal for typical startup workloads.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong>, by contrast, targets a different segment. Its <em>Archiving Service</em> and Object Storage pricing appear significantly higher (around €0.02/GB/month based on available public listings for 'Premium' tiers), positioning it as an enterprise-grade, compliance-heavy solution (e.g., for SAP or audit-proof requirements) rather than a budget-friendly bit-bucket. STACKIT lacks a permanent free tier, making it less attractive for early-stage startups focused purely on burn rate.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>The Battle of Resilience vs. Performance Transparency.</strong></p> <p>This comparison reveals a distinct divergence in architectural philosophy. <strong>Scaleway</strong> (Service A) prioritizes raw performance transparency and developer ergonomics. Their offering is strictly <em>Zonal</em> (standard for most cloud block storage), but they execute it flawlessly with explicit IOPS tiers (5k/15k) and a 99.99% SLA that relies on triple replication <em>within</em> the data center. It is the better choice for high-performance databases (DBs) where latency is king and the application handles HA (e.g., via DB replication).</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong> (Service B), however, introduces a massive <em>Hard Spec</em> advantage with its <strong>Metro Availability Zone</strong> capability. Unlike Scaleway, STACKIT offers synchronous replication across physically separate Availability Zones. This means if an entire Data Center goes dark, the block volume remains available in the surviving zone, allowing for catastrophic failure recovery without data loss. This is a "Storage Area Network (SAN) across DCs" architecture that is typically very expensive or complex to build.</p> <p><strong>Score Justification (+2 for STACKIT):</strong> While Scaleway wins on <em>Soft Specs</em> (DX, documentation, community), STACKIT's <strong>Metro</strong> feature represents a superior tier of engineering resilience that Scaleway simply does not offer for Block Storage (Scaleway only offers Multi-AZ for Object Storage). For enterprise workloads requiring maximum uptime and zero RPO during a DC failure, STACKIT is technically superior. If the comparison were purely on IOPS/Price, Scaleway would win, but the unique availability of synchronous cross-zone storage gives STACKIT the technical edge.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (Score: 0).</strong></p> <p>Both services rely on standard block storage paradigms that are easily portable at the data level (raw block devices). <strong>STACKIT</strong> uses <strong>OpenStack Cinder</strong> APIs, which is an open industry standard; migrating <em>away</em> from STACKIT to another OpenStack cloud is trivial, and tools for migrating to AWS/GCP are mature. <strong>Scaleway</strong> uses a proprietary API but provides a high-quality Terraform provider and standard K8s CSI drivers (compatible with standard Container Storage Interface). There is no proprietary data format or heavy logic lock-in for either provider. A volume is just a disk.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Pricing Models &amp; Cost Structures:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway Block Storage:</strong> Follows a simplified model charging approximately <strong>€0.086/GB/month</strong> for its Standard tier (Block Storage 5K), which includes a generous 5,000 IOPS baseline. High-performance tiers (15K IOPS) are priced higher, around <strong>€0.15/GB/month</strong>. Billing is hourly.</li><li><strong>STACKIT Block Storage:</strong> Utilizes a more granular approach with specific performance classes (e.g., Premium-Capacity, Premium-Performance). Pricing for capacity-focused storage is highly competitive, calculated at approximately <strong>€0.065/GB/month</strong> (based on hourly rates of ~€0.00009/GB). High-performance classes may incur higher costs or fixed fees per disk.</li></ul><p><strong>Value &amp; Verdict:</strong></p><p><strong>STACKIT</strong> emerges as the slightly more cost-effective option for pure storage capacity, offering rates roughly <strong>25% lower</strong> than Scaleway's standard tier. Additionally, STACKIT's policy of <strong>free data traffic</strong> (ingress and egress) provides significant savings for data-intensive workloads compared to competitors that might charge for internet egress. However, <strong>Scaleway</strong> offers better simplicity, bundling decent performance (5K IOPS) into its base price without complex tiering, making it an excellent 'set and forget' value for typical web workloads.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p>This comparison represents a clash between two fundamentally different architectural approaches: <strong>IaaS Primitive (Scaleway)</strong> vs. <strong>Compliance SaaS (STACKIT)</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Scaleway Glacier</strong> is a traditional 'Cold Storage' implementations. It behaves exactly as a cloud architect expects: you transition objects via S3 Lifecycle rules, they become inaccessible, and restoring them requires a 'thaw' request that takes 24 to 48 hours (or longer, as per user reports of up to 80 hours). Its primary strength is <strong>Standardization</strong>. Because it uses the S3 API, it integrates effortlessly with the entire modern DevOps stack.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT Archiving</strong>, conversely, is <em>not</em> a standard cold storage bucket. It is a specialized compliance vault. Its killer feature is <strong>Instant Retrieval</strong>; unlike Scaleway, there is no waiting period to access archived data. However, this comes at the cost of <strong>Versatility</strong>. It does not use the S3 API. Instead, it relies on proprietary REST endpoints or legacy SAP interfaces. For a generalist developer, this is a major regression in User Experience (UX), requiring custom SDK implementation rather than simply pointing an existing S3 client at a new endpoint.</p> <p>The score of <strong>0 (Parity)</strong> reflects this trade-off: STACKIT is technically superior in performance (instant access) and compliance rigor (hardware WORM), but Scaleway is technically superior in interoperability and ecosystem support.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Critical Discrepancy:</strong> Scaleway uses the industry-standard <strong>S3 API</strong>. Data stored in Scaleway Glacier can be migrated to AWS, Wasabi, or MinIO with minimal code changes (often just changing the endpoint URL). It scores a near-perfect +10 for portability.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT Archiving</strong> creates extreme vendor lock-in. It uses a <strong>Proprietary REST API</strong> and SAP-specific protocols. Data ingested into STACKIT Archiving cannot be simply 'synced' to another provider using tools like <code>rclone</code>. Migrating away would require building a custom extraction tool to read from their proprietary API and write to a standard target. While STACKIT offers a separate 'Object Storage' service that <em>is</em> S3-compatible, the specific 'Archiving Service' requested is a walled garden.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Glacier</strong> is the clear winner for cost-driven archival strategies, offering a price point (~€0.002/GB/month) that is effectively one of the lowest in the European market. It includes a generous <strong>75 GB free egress allowance</strong> monthly, which is rare for cold storage where retrieval costs usually sting. While they have introduced retrieval fees (~€0.009/GB), the total cost of ownership remains minimal for typical startup workloads.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong>, by contrast, targets a different segment. Its <em>Archiving Service</em> and Object Storage pricing appear significantly higher (around €0.02/GB/month based on available public listings for 'Premium' tiers), positioning it as an enterprise-grade, compliance-heavy solution (e.g., for SAP or audit-proof requirements) rather than a budget-friendly bit-bucket. STACKIT lacks a permanent free tier, making it less attractive for early-stage startups focused purely on burn rate.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>The Battle of Resilience vs. Performance Transparency.</strong></p> <p>This comparison reveals a distinct divergence in architectural philosophy. <strong>Scaleway</strong> (Service A) prioritizes raw performance transparency and developer ergonomics. Their offering is strictly <em>Zonal</em> (standard for most cloud block storage), but they execute it flawlessly with explicit IOPS tiers (5k/15k) and a 99.99% SLA that relies on triple replication <em>within</em> the data center. It is the better choice for high-performance databases (DBs) where latency is king and the application handles HA (e.g., via DB replication).</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong> (Service B), however, introduces a massive <em>Hard Spec</em> advantage with its <strong>Metro Availability Zone</strong> capability. Unlike Scaleway, STACKIT offers synchronous replication across physically separate Availability Zones. This means if an entire Data Center goes dark, the block volume remains available in the surviving zone, allowing for catastrophic failure recovery without data loss. This is a "Storage Area Network (SAN) across DCs" architecture that is typically very expensive or complex to build.</p> <p><strong>Score Justification (+2 for STACKIT):</strong> While Scaleway wins on <em>Soft Specs</em> (DX, documentation, community), STACKIT's <strong>Metro</strong> feature represents a superior tier of engineering resilience that Scaleway simply does not offer for Block Storage (Scaleway only offers Multi-AZ for Object Storage). For enterprise workloads requiring maximum uptime and zero RPO during a DC failure, STACKIT is technically superior. If the comparison were purely on IOPS/Price, Scaleway would win, but the unique availability of synchronous cross-zone storage gives STACKIT the technical edge.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (Score: 0).</strong></p> <p>Both services rely on standard block storage paradigms that are easily portable at the data level (raw block devices). <strong>STACKIT</strong> uses <strong>OpenStack Cinder</strong> APIs, which is an open industry standard; migrating <em>away</em> from STACKIT to another OpenStack cloud is trivial, and tools for migrating to AWS/GCP are mature. <strong>Scaleway</strong> uses a proprietary API but provides a high-quality Terraform provider and standard K8s CSI drivers (compatible with standard Container Storage Interface). There is no proprietary data format or heavy logic lock-in for either provider. A volume is just a disk.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Pricing Models &amp; Cost Structures:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway Block Storage:</strong> Follows a simplified model charging approximately <strong>€0.086/GB/month</strong> for its Standard tier (Block Storage 5K), which includes a generous 5,000 IOPS baseline. High-performance tiers (15K IOPS) are priced higher, around <strong>€0.15/GB/month</strong>. Billing is hourly.</li><li><strong>STACKIT Block Storage:</strong> Utilizes a more granular approach with specific performance classes (e.g., Premium-Capacity, Premium-Performance). Pricing for capacity-focused storage is highly competitive, calculated at approximately <strong>€0.065/GB/month</strong> (based on hourly rates of ~€0.00009/GB). High-performance classes may incur higher costs or fixed fees per disk.</li></ul><p><strong>Value &amp; Verdict:</strong></p><p><strong>STACKIT</strong> emerges as the slightly more cost-effective option for pure storage capacity, offering rates roughly <strong>25% lower</strong> than Scaleway's standard tier. Additionally, STACKIT's policy of <strong>free data traffic</strong> (ingress and egress) provides significant savings for data-intensive workloads compared to competitors that might charge for internet egress. However, <strong>Scaleway</strong> offers better simplicity, bundling decent performance (5K IOPS) into its base price without complex tiering, making it an excellent 'set and forget' value for typical web workloads.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway VPC</strong> is evaluated as <strong>Service A</strong>, and <strong>STACKIT Core Networking</strong> as <strong>Service B</strong>.</p>

<p>The technical comparison highlights a clash between <em>Proprietary Usability</em> (Scaleway) and <em>Standardized Flexibility</em> (STACKIT). Scaleway's VPC is a relatively recent product layer (launched ~2023) that wraps their legacy L2 Private Networks into a regional L3 construct. While it offers a polished Developer Experience (DX) with features like <strong>Public Gateways</strong> that bundle NAT and SSH bastions, it suffers from critical enterprise limitations: as of late 2025/early 2026, <strong>VPC Peering</strong> and <strong>Cross-Region Routing</strong> are still in Beta or non-existent/limited, effectively creating 'isolated islands' of infrastructure. You cannot easily route traffic between a VPC in Paris and one in Warsaw without building your own VPN overlay.</p>

<p><strong>STACKIT</strong>, largely based on the <strong>OpenStack</strong> engine, inherits the full capabilities of Neutron networking. While it lacks the 'one-click' simplicity of Scaleway's Public Gateway (requiring users to configure Routers and Floating IPs explicitly), it offers significantly more architectural freedom. Routing between subnets and networks is standard functionality, not a premium feature. However, STACKIT's offering feels less like a 'Managed Cloud Service' and more like 'Managed OpenStack,' placing the burden of network topology design firmly on the user. The score of <strong>-2</strong> reflects that while STACKIT is more open, Scaleway's proprietary abstraction provides a superior default experience for the 90% use case (web applications), whereas STACKIT's advantages are realized only by teams specifically seeking OpenStack semantics.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT</strong> achieves a perfect <strong>+10</strong> for Zero Lock-in because it exposes the standard <strong>OpenStack API</strong> endpoints. Users can authenticate using standard <code>openrc</code> files and manage their networking using the vendor-neutral <code>openstack</code> CLI or the generic <code>terraform-provider-openstack</code>. Migrating away from STACKIT to another OpenStack provider (like OVH or a private cloud) requires minimal code changes—primarily just updating endpoint URLs and credentials. <strong>Scaleway</strong>, conversely, uses a proprietary API structure. While their concepts (VPC, Subnet) are standard, the implementation is unique to their platform; moving a Terraform configuration from Scaleway to AWS or Azure requires a complete rewrite of the networking module.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Both providers offer highly aggressive, Europe-centric pricing models that completely disrupt the traditional &quot;pay-per-GB&quot; egress model found in AWS/Azure/GCP. However, <strong>STACKIT</strong> edges out Scaleway on pure cost efficiency for typical startup workloads due to its incredibly low barrier to entry for NAT/Routing.</p>

<p><strong>Scaleway VPC (Private Networks):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model:</strong> The network itself is free. Connectivity to the internet (NAT) is handled by a <strong>Public Gateway</strong>, which is a paid managed instance.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Structure:</strong> You pay an hourly rate for the Gateway instance (starting at ~€0.02/hr or ~€14.50/mo) plus the Flexible IP (~€2.90/mo).</li>
<li><strong>Value:</strong> The &quot;killer feature&quot; is that <strong>egress traffic is included</strong> in the gateway price. This makes it predictable and excellent for high-bandwidth applications, but it sets a minimum monthly cost of around €17.50 just to have private instances reach the internet.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>STACKIT Core Networking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model:</strong> The Virtual Network is free. Internet access is provided via a &quot;Public IP&quot; (formerly Router IP/Floating IP) attached to the network's logical router.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Structure:</strong> You primarily pay for the <strong>Public IP Address</strong> (~€0.004/hr or ~€2.92/mo). Crucially, STACKIT's documentation and marketing highlight that <strong>ingress and egress traffic are free of charge</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Value:</strong> By removing the separate &quot;Gateway Instance&quot; fee, STACKIT allows a private network to have NAT/Internet access for practically the cost of a coffee (~€3/mo). This is significantly cheaper than Scaleway for small-to-medium deployments that don't need dedicated multi-gigabit gateway throughput.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <strong>STACKIT</strong> is the winner for cost efficiency. While both eliminate the fear of egress bills, STACKIT eliminates the overhead of the gateway appliance, making it the most cost-effective choice for startups that want a private network without the &quot;enterprise tax&quot; of a managed gateway fee.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> is the technically superior product in terms of feature breadth and polish. It offers a <strong>fully managed Layer 7 experience</strong> that includes integrated caching (Edge Services), effortless Let's Encrypt automation via UI/API, and the ability to route to multi-cloud backends (external IPs). Its maturity shows in the seamless integration with its Kubernetes platform and the depth of its ACL (Access Control List) configurations.</p><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> is a solid contender, particularly for Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) workloads where its new 'Network Load Balancer' offers high performance and stability. However, its <strong>Layer 7 (Application Load Balancer)</strong> offering is less mature as a managed service. While it supports SSL termination and Let's Encrypt, the documentation and ecosystem imply an API-first or 'do-it-yourself' approach for advanced configurations compared to Scaleway's point-and-click simplicity. The 2024 relaunch of their load balancer portfolio indicates they are modernizing, but they currently lack the value-add features like integrated edge caching that Scaleway provides.</p><p>The score of <strong>-5</strong> reflects that while STACKIT is functional and enterprise-ready, it lags behind Scaleway in Developer Experience (DX) and advanced feature sets (Caching, Multi-cloud UI).</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> receives a positive score (+5) for lower vendor lock-in due to its foundation on <strong>OpenStack</strong>. Advanced users can interact with the load balancer using standard OpenStack APIs (Octavia) or tools, making the architectural knowledge and even some Terraform configurations portable to other OpenStack providers (e.g., OVH, T-Systems). <strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> utilizes a proprietary API and control plane. While it supports standard protocols (HTTP/TCP) and integrates with standard tools like Terraform and Kubernetes, moving away from Scaleway would require rewriting all infrastructure-as-code definitions to target a different provider's API.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for cost-efficiency in typical startup scenarios primarily due to its <strong>unmetered bandwidth model</strong>. While <strong>STACKIT</strong> offers a slightly lower base hourly rate for its entry-level Load Balancer (~€9.39/month vs. Scaleway's ~€11.68/month), the difference is negligible compared to the potential costs of data transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway</strong> charges a flat hourly fee (starting at €0.016/hr) that <em>includes</em> defined bandwidth capacities (e.g., 200 Mbps). This provides complete cost predictability, eliminating the risk of 'bill shock' from high egress traffic, which is a common volatility factor for startups.</li><li><strong>STACKIT</strong> utilizes a traditional enterprise pricing structure where the Load Balancer is billed hourly based on connection limits (e.g., 10,000 connections for the base tier). While the base price is attractive, it does not explicitly include unmetered egress, meaning traffic-heavy applications could incur significant additional variable costs.</li></ul><p>For a typical startup value-for-money analysis, the certainty of Scaleway's flat-rate bandwidth significantly outweighs the marginal base-price savings offered by STACKIT.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A) is noticeably superior due to its integrated Registrar and advanced Traffic Management capabilities.</strong></p><p>While both services offer reliable, Anycast-backed authoritative DNS, Scaleway provides a complete <em>Domain Lifecycle</em> platform. Users can register domains and immediately configure advanced routing policies like <strong>Weighted Round Robin</strong> (for canary deployments) and <strong>DNS Views</strong> (for GeoIP or Split-Horizon DNS) via a single API. This capability is essential for modern, high-availability application architectures.</p><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> is a robust <em>DNS Hosting</em> service but lacks the Registrar component (requiring users to buy domains elsewhere and delegate NS records) and does not currently expose equivalent advanced traffic steering policies in its public documentation or API. It is a solid 'infrastructure' utility, whereas Scaleway is a comprehensive 'developer' platform. Consequently, Scaleway holds a distinct feature advantage (+5 gap).</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (Score: 0).</strong></p><p>Both providers rely on proprietary API wrappers for management, meaning code written for one API will not work for the other without refactoring. However, the underlying data model for both is the standard <strong>DNS Zone File</strong> (RFC 1035). Both services support importing and exporting zone files (BIND format), making migration relatively frictionless. While STACKIT is built on OpenStack, it exposes a custom `v1` API rather than the raw OpenStack Designate `v2` endpoint, negating the specific 'open standard API' advantage. Therefore, the lock-in risk is low and symmetrical for both platforms.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> offers a highly cost-effective model for startups and general web hosting by bundling <strong>DNS management for free</strong> with every domain registered through them. Their domain registration prices are market-competitive (approx. €12/year for .com), and the inclusion of a managed DNS zone removes the recurring monthly overhead typically associated with enterprise DNS services. This makes the effective cost of DNS zero for customers consolidating their registrar and DNS provider.</p><p><strong>STACKIT</strong> utilizes a <strong>provisioned, hourly billing model</strong> based on the size of the DNS zone (number of records). Pricing starts at approximately <strong>€0.0027/hour (~€1.92/month)</strong> for a zone with up to 100 records and scales up to ~€14.80/month for 10,000 records. While this ensures guaranteed resources and Anycast availability, it introduces a recurring monthly cost that does not exist with Scaleway's bundled offering.</p><p>For a typical startup workload, <strong>Scaleway</strong> is significantly cheaper. A user maintaining 10 domains would pay ~€0/month for DNS at Scaleway (beyond the domain renewal), whereas at STACKIT, the same setup would cost nearly <strong>€20/month</strong> (10 zones × ~€1.92). STACKIT is only viable if specific enterprise-grade SLA or independent zone management (without domain transfer) is strictly required within the Schwarz Group ecosystem.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway VPC</strong> is evaluated as <strong>Service A</strong>, and <strong>STACKIT Core Networking</strong> as <strong>Service B</strong>.</p>

<p>The technical comparison highlights a clash between <em>Proprietary Usability</em> (Scaleway) and <em>Standardized Flexibility</em> (STACKIT). Scaleway's VPC is a relatively recent product layer (launched ~2023) that wraps their legacy L2 Private Networks into a regional L3 construct. While it offers a polished Developer Experience (DX) with features like <strong>Public Gateways</strong> that bundle NAT and SSH bastions, it suffers from critical enterprise limitations: as of late 2025/early 2026, <strong>VPC Peering</strong> and <strong>Cross-Region Routing</strong> are still in Beta or non-existent/limited, effectively creating 'isolated islands' of infrastructure. You cannot easily route traffic between a VPC in Paris and one in Warsaw without building your own VPN overlay.</p>

<p><strong>STACKIT</strong>, largely based on the <strong>OpenStack</strong> engine, inherits the full capabilities of Neutron networking. While it lacks the 'one-click' simplicity of Scaleway's Public Gateway (requiring users to configure Routers and Floating IPs explicitly), it offers significantly more architectural freedom. Routing between subnets and networks is standard functionality, not a premium feature. However, STACKIT's offering feels less like a 'Managed Cloud Service' and more like 'Managed OpenStack,' placing the burden of network topology design firmly on the user. The score of <strong>-2</strong> reflects that while STACKIT is more open, Scaleway's proprietary abstraction provides a superior default experience for the 90% use case (web applications), whereas STACKIT's advantages are realized only by teams specifically seeking OpenStack semantics.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT</strong> achieves a perfect <strong>+10</strong> for Zero Lock-in because it exposes the standard <strong>OpenStack API</strong> endpoints. Users can authenticate using standard <code>openrc</code> files and manage their networking using the vendor-neutral <code>openstack</code> CLI or the generic <code>terraform-provider-openstack</code>. Migrating away from STACKIT to another OpenStack provider (like OVH or a private cloud) requires minimal code changes—primarily just updating endpoint URLs and credentials. <strong>Scaleway</strong>, conversely, uses a proprietary API structure. While their concepts (VPC, Subnet) are standard, the implementation is unique to their platform; moving a Terraform configuration from Scaleway to AWS or Azure requires a complete rewrite of the networking module.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Both providers offer highly aggressive, Europe-centric pricing models that completely disrupt the traditional &quot;pay-per-GB&quot; egress model found in AWS/Azure/GCP. However, <strong>STACKIT</strong> edges out Scaleway on pure cost efficiency for typical startup workloads due to its incredibly low barrier to entry for NAT/Routing.</p>

<p><strong>Scaleway VPC (Private Networks):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model:</strong> The network itself is free. Connectivity to the internet (NAT) is handled by a <strong>Public Gateway</strong>, which is a paid managed instance.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Structure:</strong> You pay an hourly rate for the Gateway instance (starting at ~€0.02/hr or ~€14.50/mo) plus the Flexible IP (~€2.90/mo).</li>
<li><strong>Value:</strong> The &quot;killer feature&quot; is that <strong>egress traffic is included</strong> in the gateway price. This makes it predictable and excellent for high-bandwidth applications, but it sets a minimum monthly cost of around €17.50 just to have private instances reach the internet.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>STACKIT Core Networking:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model:</strong> The Virtual Network is free. Internet access is provided via a &quot;Public IP&quot; (formerly Router IP/Floating IP) attached to the network's logical router.</li>
<li><strong>Cost Structure:</strong> You primarily pay for the <strong>Public IP Address</strong> (~€0.004/hr or ~€2.92/mo). Crucially, STACKIT's documentation and marketing highlight that <strong>ingress and egress traffic are free of charge</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Value:</strong> By removing the separate &quot;Gateway Instance&quot; fee, STACKIT allows a private network to have NAT/Internet access for practically the cost of a coffee (~€3/mo). This is significantly cheaper than Scaleway for small-to-medium deployments that don't need dedicated multi-gigabit gateway throughput.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <strong>STACKIT</strong> is the winner for cost efficiency. While both eliminate the fear of egress bills, STACKIT eliminates the overhead of the gateway appliance, making it the most cost-effective choice for startups that want a private network without the &quot;enterprise tax&quot; of a managed gateway fee.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> is the technically superior product in terms of feature breadth and polish. It offers a <strong>fully managed Layer 7 experience</strong> that includes integrated caching (Edge Services), effortless Let's Encrypt automation via UI/API, and the ability to route to multi-cloud backends (external IPs). Its maturity shows in the seamless integration with its Kubernetes platform and the depth of its ACL (Access Control List) configurations.</p><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> is a solid contender, particularly for Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) workloads where its new 'Network Load Balancer' offers high performance and stability. However, its <strong>Layer 7 (Application Load Balancer)</strong> offering is less mature as a managed service. While it supports SSL termination and Let's Encrypt, the documentation and ecosystem imply an API-first or 'do-it-yourself' approach for advanced configurations compared to Scaleway's point-and-click simplicity. The 2024 relaunch of their load balancer portfolio indicates they are modernizing, but they currently lack the value-add features like integrated edge caching that Scaleway provides.</p><p>The score of <strong>-5</strong> reflects that while STACKIT is functional and enterprise-ready, it lags behind Scaleway in Developer Experience (DX) and advanced feature sets (Caching, Multi-cloud UI).</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> receives a positive score (+5) for lower vendor lock-in due to its foundation on <strong>OpenStack</strong>. Advanced users can interact with the load balancer using standard OpenStack APIs (Octavia) or tools, making the architectural knowledge and even some Terraform configurations portable to other OpenStack providers (e.g., OVH, T-Systems). <strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> utilizes a proprietary API and control plane. While it supports standard protocols (HTTP/TCP) and integrates with standard tools like Terraform and Kubernetes, moving away from Scaleway would require rewriting all infrastructure-as-code definitions to target a different provider's API.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for cost-efficiency in typical startup scenarios primarily due to its <strong>unmetered bandwidth model</strong>. While <strong>STACKIT</strong> offers a slightly lower base hourly rate for its entry-level Load Balancer (~€9.39/month vs. Scaleway's ~€11.68/month), the difference is negligible compared to the potential costs of data transfer.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway</strong> charges a flat hourly fee (starting at €0.016/hr) that <em>includes</em> defined bandwidth capacities (e.g., 200 Mbps). This provides complete cost predictability, eliminating the risk of 'bill shock' from high egress traffic, which is a common volatility factor for startups.</li><li><strong>STACKIT</strong> utilizes a traditional enterprise pricing structure where the Load Balancer is billed hourly based on connection limits (e.g., 10,000 connections for the base tier). While the base price is attractive, it does not explicitly include unmetered egress, meaning traffic-heavy applications could incur significant additional variable costs.</li></ul><p>For a typical startup value-for-money analysis, the certainty of Scaleway's flat-rate bandwidth significantly outweighs the marginal base-price savings offered by STACKIT.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A) is noticeably superior due to its integrated Registrar and advanced Traffic Management capabilities.</strong></p><p>While both services offer reliable, Anycast-backed authoritative DNS, Scaleway provides a complete <em>Domain Lifecycle</em> platform. Users can register domains and immediately configure advanced routing policies like <strong>Weighted Round Robin</strong> (for canary deployments) and <strong>DNS Views</strong> (for GeoIP or Split-Horizon DNS) via a single API. This capability is essential for modern, high-availability application architectures.</p><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> is a robust <em>DNS Hosting</em> service but lacks the Registrar component (requiring users to buy domains elsewhere and delegate NS records) and does not currently expose equivalent advanced traffic steering policies in its public documentation or API. It is a solid 'infrastructure' utility, whereas Scaleway is a comprehensive 'developer' platform. Consequently, Scaleway holds a distinct feature advantage (+5 gap).</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (Score: 0).</strong></p><p>Both providers rely on proprietary API wrappers for management, meaning code written for one API will not work for the other without refactoring. However, the underlying data model for both is the standard <strong>DNS Zone File</strong> (RFC 1035). Both services support importing and exporting zone files (BIND format), making migration relatively frictionless. While STACKIT is built on OpenStack, it exposes a custom `v1` API rather than the raw OpenStack Designate `v2` endpoint, negating the specific 'open standard API' advantage. Therefore, the lock-in risk is low and symmetrical for both platforms.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> offers a highly cost-effective model for startups and general web hosting by bundling <strong>DNS management for free</strong> with every domain registered through them. Their domain registration prices are market-competitive (approx. €12/year for .com), and the inclusion of a managed DNS zone removes the recurring monthly overhead typically associated with enterprise DNS services. This makes the effective cost of DNS zero for customers consolidating their registrar and DNS provider.</p><p><strong>STACKIT</strong> utilizes a <strong>provisioned, hourly billing model</strong> based on the size of the DNS zone (number of records). Pricing starts at approximately <strong>€0.0027/hour (~€1.92/month)</strong> for a zone with up to 100 records and scales up to ~€14.80/month for 10,000 records. While this ensures guaranteed resources and Anycast availability, it introduces a recurring monthly cost that does not exist with Scaleway's bundled offering.</p><p>For a typical startup workload, <strong>Scaleway</strong> is significantly cheaper. A user maintaining 10 domains would pay ~€0/month for DNS at Scaleway (beyond the domain renewal), whereas at STACKIT, the same setup would cost nearly <strong>€20/month</strong> (10 zones × ~€1.92). STACKIT is only viable if specific enterprise-grade SLA or independent zone management (without domain transfer) is strictly required within the Schwarz Group ecosystem.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> is positioned as a modern, hyperscaler-grade managed service, while <strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> operates on a legacy 'Infrastructure-as-a-Service' (IaaS) appliance model. This fundamental architectural difference drives the score.</p><ul><li><strong>Architecture & DX:</strong> Scaleway offers a true <em>Managed VPN Gateway</em>. You define a resource, and the platform handles high availability, patching, and scaling. STACKIT, by contrast, relies on a 'VPN Appliance' blueprint. Users must provision a VM, configure OpenStack routers, and manage floating IPs. This results in significantly higher friction and operational overhead for STACKIT users.</li><li><strong>Maturity & Features:</strong> While Scaleway is in <em>Public Beta</em> (as of late 2025/early 2026), its feature set is already more advanced for cloud-native workflows, including native BGP and Secret Manager integration. STACKIT is 'Stable' but functionally basic; achieving BGP or HA requires complex manual configuration of the appliance and underlying network fabric.</li><li><strong>The Verdict:</strong> Service B (STACKIT) is <strong>Noticeably Inferior</strong> (-5) because it forces the user to manage infrastructure (VMs/Appliances) for a capability that is standard commodity PaaS on almost every other modern cloud, including Scaleway.</li></ul><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Service B (STACKIT)</strong> has a slight edge in portability (+5) because its 'lock-in' is effectively zero. Since the VPN is implemented as an appliance (likely StrongSwan or similar software on a VM) which the user deploys, the entire configuration can be lifted and shifted to any other cloud or on-premise server without translation. <strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> uses standard protocols (IKEv2/IPsec), ensuring connectivity interoperability (Score 0/Parity), but the <em>management</em> of the gateway is tied to Scaleway's specific API and control plane logic.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for cost-efficiency and predictability for typical startup workloads. Its model of bundling bandwidth into a flat monthly rate (or capped hourly rate) is highly advantageous compared to the traditional <em>Gateway Fee + Data Transfer</em> model.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway (Winner):</strong> Uses a &quot;T-Shirt Size&quot; model. The entry-level <strong>VGW-XXS</strong> tier offers 100 Mbps bandwidth for approximately <strong>€29.50/month</strong> (or €0.0404/hour). Crucially, this price <em>includes</em> the traffic up to that speed limit. For a startup, this removes the risk of unexpected egress bills. The cost is slightly lower than the raw tunnel fee of hyperscalers (like AWS at ~$36/month) before data is even added.</li><li><strong>STACKIT:</strong> Follows a stricter &quot;Pay-As-You-Go&quot; model. While specific VPN appliance pricing is opaque (often hidden inside generic Compute/Network costs), their billing emphasizes hourly consumption and separate line items for <strong>Public IPs</strong> and likely <strong>Data Egress</strong>. While this allows for granular billing, the lack of a &quot;bandwidth-inclusive&quot; flat tier makes it riskier and likely more expensive for active tunnels transferring significant data.</li></ul><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Scaleway receives a high positive score because it transforms a variable cost (VPN traffic) into a fixed, low operational cost, which is ideal for financial planning.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Comparison Overview:</strong> Service B (STACKIT SKE) represents a solid, compliance-focused 'Utility Kubernetes' offering, whereas Service A (Scaleway Kapsule) is a feature-rich, developer-centric platform. The score reflects the significant feature gap between the two.</p> <p><strong>Feature Depth (The Gap):</strong> Scaleway (A) is noticeably superior in terms of capability. The inclusion of <em>Kosmos</em> (managed multi-cloud control plane), native ARM64 support, and a polished CLI/Terraform experience places it ahead of STACKIT. STACKIT (B) is a robust 'Vanilla' implementation based on Gardener, but it lacks the advanced flexibility (e.g., attaching external nodes, serverless k8s integration) that modern cloud-native developers expect from a mature platform. STACKIT feels like 'Infrastructure' while Scaleway feels like a 'Platform'.</p> <p><strong>Stability vs. Velocity:</strong> While Service A (Scaleway) theoretically wins on features, recent 2025/2026 reports indicate <em>instability</em> (registry outages, network degradation), which is a significant soft-spec penalty. However, Service B (STACKIT) has not yet demonstrated enough unique technical value (beyond compliance/Gardener) to offset the raw feature dominance of A. B is a 'safe, boring' choice, while A is the 'advanced but currently volatile' choice.</p> <p><strong>Score Justification (-4):</strong> STACKIT is rated -4 because it lacks the <em>Technical Maturity</em> features of Scaleway (ARM, Multi-cloud control plane, Serverless integration). It is not 'Critically Flawed' (-10) as it is a stable, CNCF-compliant engine, but it is 'Noticeably Inferior' (-5 range) in terms of the toolset available to engineers.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Open Standards:</strong> Both services rely on standard Kubernetes APIs, meaning workload migration via YAML manifests is trivial for stateless applications. <br> <strong>Service A (Scaleway):</strong> Uses a custom control plane manager but supports standard CNIs (Cilium/Calico). Its 'Kosmos' feature actually <em>reduces</em> infrastructure lock-in by allowing you to run nodes on other clouds, theoretically easing migration <em>away</em> from Scaleway compute while keeping the management layer.<br> <strong>Service B (STACKIT):</strong> Uses the <em>Gardener</em> project, which is open-source. This theoretically allows you to re-platform to another Gardener-based provider (e.g., SAP) with identical cluster specs, but this is a niche use case. <br> <strong>Verdict:</strong> Since both are managed Kubernetes services without proprietary API gates (unlike GKE Autopilot's restrictions), the Lock-in score is 0. Neither enforces high exit costs beyond standard data egress fees.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Kapsule</strong> is aggressively positioned as a value leader in the European market. Its pricing model is highly favorable for startups due to three main factors: a <strong>free managed control plane</strong>, extremely low-cost worker nodes (e.g., the <em>PLAY2</em> and <em>DEV1</em> series), and a policy of <strong>zero egress fees</strong> for standard internet traffic. A typical entry-level node (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) on Scaleway can cost as little as <strong>€14-€20/month</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>StackIT SKE</strong>, while offering a robust, sovereign European cloud platform backed by the Schwarz Group, carries a premium price tag characteristic of enterprise-focused providers. While the control plane is managed, the underlying compute instances are significantly more expensive than Scaleway's equivalent tiers. A comparable general-purpose instance on StackIT can cost roughly <strong>2x to 3x</strong> more than Scaleway's cost-optimized options (approx. <strong>€44-€60/month</strong> for similar specs). Additionally, while StackIT offers transparent pricing, it lacks the ultra-low-cost &quot;sandbox&quot; instances that Scaleway provides for non-critical workloads.</p>
<p>For a typical startup prioritizing runway and value-for-money, <strong>Scaleway</strong> is the overwhelming winner. StackIT is viable primarily where specific German data sovereignty compliance (beyond standard GDPR) or enterprise relationships with the Schwarz Group are required.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>The Maturity vs. Capability Trade-off:</strong> Scaleway receives the higher technical standing purely due to <strong>operational maturity</strong>. As a service that has been GA for years, Scaleway offers a predictable, stable environment with a 'set and forget' quality that STACKIT, which entered Beta in mid-2025, cannot yet match. For production workloads where uptime SLAs and support responsiveness are paramount, Scaleway is the safe default.</p><p><strong>Feature Depth (The Harbor Factor):</strong> However, technically astute teams may prefer STACKIT explicitly because it appears to be a managed instance of <strong>Project Harbor</strong> (CNCF Graduated). This gives STACKIT advanced capabilities 'out of the box' that Scaleway's custom mutualized backend lacks, such as:</p><ul><li><strong>Pull-through Caching:</strong> Native ability to cache Docker Hub images to avoid rate limits (a standard Harbor feature).</li><li><strong>Complex Retention Policies:</strong> Granular 'Garbage Collection' rules based on tag patterns and build dates, whereas Scaleway's retention tooling is more basic.</li><li><strong>Robot Accounts:</strong> First-class support for non-human identities, a staple of Harbor.</li></ul><p>Despite these feature advantages, STACKIT scores lower (-2) because the service is still solidifying. Early adopters face 'Beta' risks—potential API breaking changes, less polished documentation, and a reliance on community-driven Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools rather than official, vendor-guaranteed providers.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT (Harbor) is the Gold Standard for Portability:</strong> STACKIT's architecture effectively provides a managed instance of Harbor, the open-source industry standard for registries. This results in near-zero lock-in. A user can export their configuration, replication rules, and access policies and import them into any other Harbor instance (on-premises, AWS, or another provider) with minimal friction. The API is not just 'compatible' with Docker; it <em>is</em> the standard OCI distribution spec plus the standard Harbor API.</p><p><strong>Scaleway (Proprietary Wrapper):</strong> While Scaleway supports the standard Docker/OCI push/pull protocols (ensuring image portability is high), the <em>management</em> layer—permissions, webhooks, namespace settings—is proprietary to Scaleway's API. migrating away involves re-implementing these logic layers, whereas migrating away from STACKIT is largely a 'replication' task supported natively by the software itself.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Container Registry</strong> operates on a traditional cloud pricing model where costs are driven by storage volume and external bandwidth. Its standout feature is a <strong>75GB free tier</strong>, but this is restricted solely to <em>public</em> images. For a typical startup with proprietary (private) code, this free tier provides zero value, and billing begins immediately at <strong>€0.027/GB/month</strong>. Furthermore, while intra-region bandwidth (pulling images to Scaleway servers) is free, external bandwidth (pulling images to local developer machines or CI/CD pipelines outside Scaleway) is charged at <strong>€0.033/GB</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>STACKIT Container Registry</strong>, launched in mid-2025, entered the market with a <strong>Free Beta</strong> phase. Even assuming a transition to General Availability (GA) by 2026, STACKIT typically prices its storage competitively (parity with object storage at approx. €0.027/GB) but differentiates itself aggressively on bandwidth. STACKIT generally offers <strong>unlimited egress traffic</strong>, eliminating the "tax" on external image pulls that Scaleway imposes. For a startup engaging in frequent local development and utilizing private repositories, STACKIT offers a superior value proposition by removing bandwidth anxiety and potentially waiving storage fees during its extended rollout phase.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Service B (STACKIT) is Noticeably Inferior (-5) to Service A (Scaleway).</strong> While STACKIT offers a robust and reliable <em>provisioned</em> PostgreSQL service that meets enterprise standards (particularly for sovereignty-focused use cases), it lacks the architectural breadth of Scaleway. Scaleway provides both a mature provisioned service <em>and</em> a next-generation <strong>Serverless SQL</strong> offering that allows for scale-to-zero and usage-based pricing—a paradigm completely absent in STACKIT's portfolio.</p> <p>Furthermore, Scaleway's developer ecosystem is significantly more mature. Its Terraform provider is stable, whereas STACKIT's is still in version 0.x. Scaleway's documentation and community footprint are larger, reducing friction for developers troubleshooting edge cases. STACKIT's 'Flex' capabilities (scaling storage/compute) are good, but they are matched by Scaleway's provisioned offerings (which also allow block storage scaling). The lack of a Serverless option and the relative immaturity of the IaC tools result in a negative technical gap.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Service B (STACKIT) has slightly lower lock-in (+2).</strong> Both services are fundamentally wrappers around open-source PostgreSQL, ensuring high data portability (standard pg_dump/restore works for both). However, Scaleway's differentiation comes with a 'soft' lock-in risk: its <em>Serverless SQL</em> offering has specific limitations (e.g., no Change Data Capture/CDC, specific connection pooling behaviors) that may require application-side architecting. If a user adopts Scaleway Serverless, migrating <em>away</em> requires re-evaluating these architectural choices. STACKIT offers a purely standard, provisioned PostgreSQL experience without these proprietary behaviors, making it a more generic 'drop-in' replacement with marginally lower exit friction.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway is the decisive winner for cost-conscious startups and value-for-money.</strong> The price disparity between the two providers is stark, particularly at the entry level.</p><ul><li><strong>Entry-Level Discrepancy:</strong> For a typical startup workload (e.g., 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM), Scaleway's <em>Play2-Nano</em> instance costs approximately <strong>€20/month</strong>. STACKIT's comparable <em>Flex-2.4-Single</em> instance costs roughly <strong>€90/month</strong>. This is a <strong>4.5x price difference</strong> for effectively the same compute resources.</li><li><strong>Production Value:</strong> Even when moving to production-grade instances, Scaleway maintains a lead. A Scaleway <em>Pro2-XXS</em> instance provides <strong>2 vCPU and 8GB RAM</strong> for ~€80/month. STACKIT charges ~€90/month for <strong>2 vCPU and 4GB RAM</strong>. Scaleway provides double the memory for a lower price.</li><li><strong>Billing Model:</strong> Both use hourly billing, but Scaleway's segmentation into 'Play' (Dev/Test) and 'Pro' (Production) allows users to optimize costs significantly during development phases, a flexibility STACKIT lacks with its high starting price point.</li></ul><p>While STACKIT offers a strong proposition for data sovereignty within the German market, strictly from a financial FinOps perspective, its pricing is hostile to early-stage startups compared to Scaleway's commoditized, aggressive pricing strategy.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A) is noticeably superior to STACKIT (Service B) regarding platform maturity, version currency, and developer tooling.</strong></p> <p>While both services provide managed Redis instances with support for clustering and persistence, Scaleway delivers a more modern and agile product. Key differentiators include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Engine Versioning:</strong> Scaleway supports <strong>Redis 7.2.11</strong>, ensuring access to the latest performance improvements and functions (e.g., triggering functions, sharded Pub/Sub). STACKIT's documentation and release notes indicate a recent (Dec 2025) rollout of &quot;Redis 7&quot; (likely 7.0 base), placing it significantly behind the upstream release cycle.</li> <li><strong>Infrastructure Tooling:</strong> Scaleway offers a polished, HashiCorp-validated Terraform provider and a comprehensive CLI. STACKIT's Terraform support has historically been community-driven or in transition, which introduces friction for rigorous IaC adoption outside of Cloud Foundry.</li> <li><strong>Topology Options:</strong> Scaleway offers a clear path from Dev (Standalone) to Prod (HA) to Scale (Cluster), with explicit controls over node counts (3-6 for cluster). STACKIT's architecture is more opaque, often abstracted behind service plans (e.g., &quot;Replica Set&quot;) that may not offer the same granular control over sharding topology.</li> </ul> <p>STACKIT is a viable choice specifically for users within the Schwarz IT ecosystem or those heavily invested in Cloud Foundry, but for a general-purpose cloud architecture, it lacks the feature depth and velocity of Scaleway.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (Zero Lock-in):</strong> Both providers offer managed services wrapping the standard open-source Redis engine. There are no significant proprietary APIs or data formats introduced by either vendor.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Protocol Compatibility:</strong> Both services support the standard Redis Wire Protocol, allowing the use of any standard Redis client (redis-py, Jedis, etc.).</li> <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Both allow for the import/export of RDB files (Snapshots), ensuring that data can be migrated to another provider or self-hosted instance with minimal effort.</li> <li><strong>Integration:</strong> While STACKIT favors the Open Service Broker API, this is an open standard. Scaleway uses standard REST APIs and Terraform. Switching costs are primarily operational (re-pointing DNS/IPs) rather than technical.</li> </ul><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Managed Redis</strong> is generally the more cost-effective option for startups, primarily due to its flexibility in High Availability (HA) configurations and aggressive base pricing. Scaleway allows users to deploy a <strong>2-node HA setup</strong> (Primary + Replica), whereas <strong>STACKIT's</strong> HA offering (termed 'Replica') typically provisions a <strong>3-node cluster</strong> by default. For a startup seeking redundancy without paying for a third node, Scaleway offers immediate savings.</p> <ul><li><strong>Scaleway:</strong> Positioning itself as a budget-friendly cloud provider, its standalone Redis instances start at approximately <strong>€29/month</strong> (€0.04/hour). The pricing model is simple, linear based on RAM/vCPU, and transparent.</li><li><strong>STACKIT:</strong> While competitive, STACKIT focuses on data sovereignty and enterprise compliance (German cloud). Its pricing is usage-based, but the structural requirement for 3 nodes to achieve the 'Replica' service level increases the minimum monthly spend for HA workloads compared to Scaleway.</li></ul> <p>For a typical startup workload that requires a balance of cost and reliability, Scaleway's ability to offer a lower entry point for both standalone and HA configurations gives it the edge.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Architecture & Scalability (The 'Big Data' Gap):</strong> The most critical technical differentiator is scaling strategy. <strong>STACKIT</strong> supports <em>Sharded Clusters</em>, enabling horizontal scaling for write-heavy or massive datasets (beyond the capacity of a single node). <strong>Scaleway</strong> is restricted to <em>Replica Sets</em>, forcing users to rely solely on Vertical Scaling (upgrading CPU/RAM) which hits a hard ceiling. For a NoSQL database often chosen specifically for scale, Scaleway's lack of native sharding support is a significant limitation.</p> <p><strong>Engine & Features:</strong> STACKIT explicitly provides the <strong>Enterprise Version</strong> of MongoDB, unlocking advanced security features (like granular auditing and LDAP integration) that are absent in Scaleway's <strong>Community Edition</strong> 7.0 offering. Furthermore, STACKIT's 'Flex' model allows users to scale storage independently of compute and choose storage performance tiers, offering granular architectural control that Scaleway's rigid node-type model lacks.</p> <p><strong>Developer Experience:</strong> Scaleway imposes a notable friction point: its Managed MongoDB is incompatible with Static NAT on Public Gateways, forcing developers to configure <em>SSH Bastions</em> for private network access—a clumsy pattern in modern cloud infrastructure. STACKIT provides a more seamless networking experience with standard ACLs and public IP options.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Open Standards:</strong> Both services utilize the standard MongoDB wire protocol and are compatible with official MongoDB drivers and tools (mongosh, Compass, Terraform). Migrating data out of either service is straightforward using standard tools like <code>mongodump</code> or <code>mongosync</code>.</p> <p><strong>Feature Nuance:</strong> While STACKIT offers 'Enterprise' features, utilizing them (e.g., specific audit log formats) creates a 'soft' lock-in where degrading to a Community Edition provider (like Scaleway or self-hosted) would result in feature loss. However, this is a choice rather than a platform constraint. Since the underlying data engine is identical and standard, the lock-in score remains neutral.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p>For a typical startup workload, <strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner in terms of pure cost efficiency. Its pricing model includes a distinct &quot;Shared&quot; (Play2) tier designed specifically for development and small-production workloads, with entry-level replica sets (3 nodes) costing approximately <strong>€25-€30/month</strong> (based on ~€0.036/node/hour). This provides High Availability (HA) at a price point that is hard to beat in the European market.</p>  <p><strong>StackIT</strong>, conversely, targets the Enterprise market (as part of the Schwarz Group). Its &quot;MongoDB Flex&quot; model is technically superior for scaling&mdash;allowing you to size storage independently of RAM/CPU&mdash;but this flexibility typically comes with a higher base price suited for mission-critical corporate data rather than lean startups. StackIT lacks a publicly promoted low-cost &quot;Shared&quot; tier, meaning users likely start at a Dedicated resource price point.</p>  <p><strong>Value for Money Verdict:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Scaleway</strong>: Best for Startups. You get managed HA (Replica Sets) for the price of a single dedicated node elsewhere. The 30-day trial reduces initial risk.</li> <li><strong>StackIT</strong>: Best for Compliance/Enterprise. If your &quot;value&quot; metric includes strict GDPR adherence and German data sovereignty with enterprise SLAs, StackIT justifies the premium, but for raw compute/dollar, it trails Scaleway.</li> </ul>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Comparison: Niche Serverless vs. Enterprise Managed</strong></p><p>The technical gap between these services is defined by their intended use cases. <strong>STACKIT PostgreSQL Flex (Service B)</strong> is a robust, general-purpose relational database service suitable for primary storage in enterprise applications. It adheres to the standard PostgreSQL specification, meaning it supports complex queries, large transactions, and the vast ecosystem of PostgreSQL tools (e.g., pgAdmin, Tableau, Airbyte) without modification. Its 'Hard Specs' include a 3-node HA architecture and configurable backups, making it a reliable choice for production workloads requiring SLAs.</p><p><strong>Scaleway Serverless SQL (Service A)</strong> is technically impressive as a cost-optimization tool but falls short on versatility. While it offers true <em>scale-to-zero</em> (a feature B lacks), the trade-offs are significant. The service acts more like a 'Data API' than a full RDBMS, imposing hard limits such as a 1MB request size and blocking essential SQL features like <code>TEMPORARY TABLES</code>. These limitations break compatibility with many standard ORMs and ETL tools, forcing developers to architect around the platform's constraints. Consequently, Service B receives a higher score for being a fully capable database, whereas Service A is penalized for being a constrained subset of PostgreSQL, despite its autoscaling innovation.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Standards vs. Constraints</strong></p><p>While both services utilize the open-source PostgreSQL engine, <strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> introduces a form of 'architectural lock-in' through its proprietary proxy limitations. By disabling standard features like temporary tables and logical replication subscriptions, Scaleway forces applications to be written in a specific, non-standard way. Migrating an existing standard PostgreSQL application <em>to</em> Scaleway often requires code refactoring. Migrating <em>away</em> is technically easy (data dump), but the application logic developed for Scaleway might be overly simplistic or idiosyncratic.</p><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> acts as a standard Managed PostgreSQL provider. It supports the full wire protocol and feature set, ensuring 100% portability. An application running on STACKIT can be moved to AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or a self-hosted VM with zero code changes. Therefore, Service B offers significantly better portability and ecosystem compatibility.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Serverless SQL</strong> is the clear winner for <em>early-stage startups</em>, <em>development environments</em>, and <em>intermittent workloads</em> due to its ability to <strong>scale to zero</strong>. If your application is idle (e.g., at night or during early development), you pay only for storage (approx. €0.20/GB/month), whereas STACKIT requires a provisioned instance running 24/7.</p> <p>However, <strong>STACKIT PostgreSQL Flex</strong> becomes significantly more cost-effective for <strong>steady-state production workloads</strong>. Its entry-level instance (approx. 2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM) costs around <strong>€0.126/hour</strong> (~€90/month). In contrast, Scaleway charges approx. <strong>€0.136/hour</strong> for just 1 vCPU when active. This means for a database running 24/7, STACKIT offers <strong>double the compute resources for a lower price</strong>.</p> <p>For a &quot;typical startup workload&quot; (often characterized by low initial traffic and multiple non-production environments), Scaleway's model avoids the ~$90/month floor of STACKIT, earning it the efficiency recommendation. But as traffic stabilizes, migrating to STACKIT's provisioned model would yield substantial savings.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ is the technically superior choice for production/enterprise workloads, while Scaleway NATS is a niche 'Serverless' wrapper with critical limitations.</strong></p><p>The comparison highlights a trade-off between <em>Control</em> and <em>Abstraction</em>, where Scaleway's abstraction currently removes too much utility:</p><ul><li><strong>Feature Completeness:</strong> STACKIT provides a standard RabbitMQ experience. You select a plan (e.g., <code>RabbitMQ-4.8.50-Replica</code>), get a 3-node cluster, and use it exactly as you would on-premise. It supports complex routing, dead-letter exchanges, and standard monitoring tools. Scaleway NATS, conversely, imposes artificial hard limits (latest docs cite <strong>50 streams per project</strong>), which is prohibitively low for microservices architectures that often require hundreds of streams.</li><li><strong>Observability & Ops:</strong> Scaleway explicitly notes that the <em>monitoring endpoint is not available</em>, forcing users to implement workarounds (like sidecars) to track metrics. STACKIT allows standard metric export and integrates with logging pipelines.</li><li><strong>Security & RBAC:</strong> STACKIT leverages standard RabbitMQ ACLs. Scaleway NATS uses a simplified credential model where one 'Account' context often lacks the granular user-level permissions (ACLs) required for strict service isolation.</li></ul><p>While Scaleway's <em>serverless billing</em> is attractive for sporadic workloads, STACKIT's <em>predictable performance</em> and lack of logical quotas make it the robust winner.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (0).</strong> Both services rely on open-source engines (NATS vs. RabbitMQ) and expose standard protocol endpoints. Migrating away from either service primarily involves instantiating a self-hosted cluster and updating connection strings.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway NATS:</strong> Uses standard NATS client libraries. The only 'lock-in' is the proprietary API used to generate the <code>.creds</code> (NKeys) file, but the underlying protocol is pure CNCF NATS.</li><li><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ:</strong> Uses standard AMQP 0-9-1. Migration is seamless using built-in RabbitMQ definitions export/import (Shovel/Federation).</li></ul><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway NATS</strong> offers a vastly superior cost model for startups through its serverless architecture. You are billed strictly on <strong>volume (€0.01/GB)</strong> and <strong>persistence (~€0.14/GB/month)</strong>. For a typical startup sending even hundreds of gigabytes of messages, the monthly bill would remain under €5. This model allows for scaling to zero costs when idle.</p><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong>, by contrast, utilizes a <strong>Provisioned</strong> model. You must select a Service Plan (e.g., Single Instance or Replica Cluster) and pay an hourly rate regardless of traffic. The smallest entry-level production-ready instance (Single Node, 2 vCPU) is estimated to cost roughly <strong>€40-€50/month</strong>, and a High Availability cluster (3 nodes) would exceed <strong>€100/month</strong>. While this model provides dedicated performance for enterprise workloads, it represents a significant 'creation tax' for early-stage projects.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Unless your application strictly requires RabbitMQ-specific protocols (AMQP), <strong>Scaleway NATS</strong> is the overwhelmingly more cost-effective choice, potentially saving 99% on the bill for early-stage workloads.</p>

Its serverless nature means developers can fire-and-forget without provisioning instances, and the usage-based pricing is ideal for sporadic workloads. However, it is held back by significant <strong>Hard Spec</strong> limitations, most notably the <strong>50 queues per project</strong> quota (confirmed late 2025 documentation) and a 256KB message size cap. These limits severely restrict its utility for complex microservice architectures where a 1:1 service-to-queue mapping is common.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ (Service B)</strong> is a <strong>Noticeably Superior</strong> technical offering for enterprise workloads. While it requires provisioning (selecting VM sizes), it provides the full power of the AMQP protocol, enabling sub-millisecond latency (via persistent connections/push) and complex routing logic that SQS cannot emulate. The ability to deploy Multi-AZ clusters ensures high availability, and the absence of arbitrary resource caps allows it to scale to thousands of queues. For any scenario requiring real-time messaging, ordering guarantees, or high throughput, STACKIT is the technically more capable platform.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Service B (STACKIT)</strong> is a pristine example of <strong>Zero Lock-in</strong> (+10). It provides a managed instance of RabbitMQ, the industry-standard open-source message broker. Users can export their configuration (definitions.json) and messages and migrate instantly to any other RabbitMQ provider (AWS MQ, CloudAMQP) or self-hosted Docker containers with zero code changes.</p> <p><strong>Service A (Scaleway)</strong> uses the <strong>AWS SQS Protocol</strong>. While this is a public API standard, it is a proprietary API owned by Amazon. Migrating <em>away</em> from Scaleway usually implies moving to AWS. Moving to a non-SQS provider (like RabbitMQ or Kafka) requires a complete rewrite of the application's messaging logic (replacing polling loops with consumers, changing SDKs). Thus, B offers absolute portability, while A ties you to a specific vendor's API design.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Queues</strong> utilizes a <em>serverless, pay-per-use</em> model based on the SQS protocol. This is significantly more cost-effective for typical startups and variable workloads because you only pay for the actual API requests (messages). Costs scale linearly with usage and drop to zero when idle.</p><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong> uses a <em>provisioned</em> model where you rent dedicated instances (Virtual Machines) to run the broker. Pricing starts at approximately <strong>€0.20/hour (~€144/month)</strong> for a high-availability replica set (Small). Even a single-node setup (if recommended for dev) would incur fixed hourly costs regardless of whether you process one message or a million.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> For a typical startup workload, Scaleway is drastically cheaper (likely cents vs. hundreds of Euros). STACKIT is only viable if you specifically require the RabbitMQ protocol (AMQP) or have a sustained, high-throughput workload that would make per-request billing expensive.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Comparison: Serverless Notification Bus vs. Enterprise Message Broker</strong></p><p>The technical disparity here is defined by the architectural purpose and reliability guarantees. <strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ (Service B)</strong> represents a robust, general-purpose Message Broker capable of handling complex enterprise patterns—request/reply, work queues, and ordered delivery—with the reliability of a provisioned cluster. <strong>Scaleway Topics (Service A)</strong> is a specialized 'Notification' service based on the AWS SNS protocol. While A offers a modern 'Serverless' DX (pay-per-request, auto-scale), it is severely hampered by its reported <strong>99% SLA</strong>, which implies significantly higher allowable downtime (approx. 3.65 days/year) compared to standard managed brokers.</p><ul><li><strong>Protocol & Capability:</strong> STACKIT (RabbitMQ) offers a superset of functionality. While Scaleway Topics is limited to 'Fanout' and 'Push' (SNS), RabbitMQ can perform Fanout <em>plus</em> complex routing, buffering, and varying degrees of persistence.</li><li><strong>Reliability:</strong> STACKIT's provisioned cluster model with queue mirroring is architecturally superior for data durability and uptime compared to Scaleway's current SLA offering.</li><li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Scaleway is superior only for sporadic, low-priority webhooks or triggering serverless functions where managing a broker is overkill. For any persistent data flow, STACKIT is the necessary choice.</li></ul><p>The score of <strong>+6</strong> reflects that while Scaleway offers 'Next-Gen' serverless convenience, the functional limitations of the SNS protocol combined with a sub-standard SLA make STACKIT the technically superior option for serious messaging infrastructure.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Open Standard vs. Proprietary API Emulation</strong></p><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong> relies on the open-source <strong>AMQP 0-9-1</strong> standard and the actual RabbitMQ engine. This ensures <strong>Zero Lock-in</strong> (+10 absolute score); a user can migrate their configuration and code to any other cloud provider, on-premise server, or local machine running RabbitMQ with no code changes.</p><p><strong>Scaleway Topics</strong> relies on an emulation of the <strong>AWS SNS API</strong>. While this is a 'De Facto' standard that allows easy migration <em>to/from AWS</em>, it locks the user into the specific semantics of the SNS API. Migrating to a non-AWS/non-Scaleway provider would require rewriting the messaging layer to a different protocol (like NATS or Kafka). Therefore, Service B is noticeably more portable across the broader industry than Service A.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p>This is a comparison between a <strong>Serverless Pub/Sub</strong> service (Scaleway Topics and Events) and a <strong>Provisioned Message Broker</strong> (STACKIT RabbitMQ). For a typical startup workload, the cost dynamics are vastly different.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway Topics and Events</strong> utilizes a truly serverless pricing model. You are billed based on the <strong>volume of data</strong> (message payload size) and the number of messages. This means a startup with sporadic traffic or an application in development pays effectively <strong>zero</strong> (or pennies) per month. There is no cost for idle time.</li><li><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong> follows a traditional Enterprise Cloud model where you must provision a specific instance size (e.g., <em>RabbitMQ-2.4.10-Single</em> with 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM). You are charged an hourly rate for this capacity regardless of whether you process one message or a million. This creates a high <strong>barrier to entry</strong> (minimum monthly spend estimated at €30-€60+) compared to Scaleway.</li></ul><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> STACKIT is significantly more expensive for startups due to its mandatory minimum commit for running instances. Scaleway offers a financially superior model for new or scaling applications by eliminating idle resource costs.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B) receives a score of +2 relative to Scaleway (Service A).</strong></p>
<p>The primary differentiator is the service scope and target audience. Scaleway explicitly brands its offering as <em>'Cloud Essentials'</em>, stating in documentation that it aims to provide a <em>'minimal feature set'</em> focused on ease of deployment. This approach is excellent for developers who want a 'battery-included' standard search engine without complexity, but it implies intentional guardrails against advanced configuration (e.g., custom plugin uploads, complex cluster topologies). Scaleway's <em>Standalone</em> (single node) and <em>High Availability</em> (3-node) plans are rigid but effective.</p>
<p>STACKIT, conversely, positions its OpenSearch service as a robust, enterprise-grade component of its Sovereign Cloud. While it doesn't offer the next-gen serverless paradigms of AWS, it presents a more 'complete' managed service profile suitable for regulated enterprise workloads that require strict data sovereignty (German data centers). It supports standard enterprise requirements like IP whitelisting, comprehensive backups, and integration with the wider STACKIT observability suite.</p>
<p>Scaleway wins purely on <strong>Developer Experience (DX)</strong>—its documentation, CLI, and Terraform provider are industry-standard and a joy to use. However, for a 'Technical Audit' prioritizing feature depth and enterprise readiness over pricing, STACKIT's positioning as a full-service platform rather than an 'Essential' tier gives it a slight technical edge for production-critical, regulated workloads.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Score: 0 (Symmetrical Standards).</strong></p>
<p>Both services are managed wrappers around the open-source <strong>OpenSearch</strong> engine. Neither vendor imposes proprietary APIs or data formats that would hinder migration. Data can be exported using standard OpenSearch/Elasticsearch APIs (Snapshot/Restore) or tools like Logstash/Data Prepper.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scaleway:</strong> Uses standard OpenSearch endpoints. No proprietary extensions are forced upon the user.</li>
<li><strong>STACKIT:</strong> Adheres strictly to open standards as part of its 'Sovereign Cloud' promise, ensuring full reversibility and data portability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving between these providers (or to self-hosted) is a standard data migration task with zero refactoring required for the application layer.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for cost efficiency, offering significantly better raw performance per Euro. Their entry-level <strong>Shared</strong> node delivers <strong>8GB of RAM for ~€72/month</strong> (€0.099/hour), which is a critical specification for OpenSearch (Java Heap). <strong>StackIT</strong> charges a nearly identical price (~€72/month) for their entry-level OpenSearch plan, but given their raw compute pricing (where unmanaged 8GB instances cost ~€99/month), this managed tier likely provides only <strong>4GB of RAM</strong> or fewer CPU resources.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway:</strong> Offers a high-value 'Standalone' tier ideal for startups, giving you enough RAM (8GB) to run a functional non-HA cluster for under €75/month.</li><li><strong>StackIT:</strong> While competitive for the German market and compliance-heavy workloads, the value-for-money on raw hardware specs is lower. You likely pay a premium for the 'Managed' aspect relative to the underlying hardware.</li></ul><p>For a typical startup looking to maximize runway, Scaleway provides twice the RAM for the same price point.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A) is noticeably superior in feature set and flexibility compared to STACKIT (Service B).</strong> While STACKIT offers a solid, secure foundation with its default 3-node architecture—appealing to risk-averse enterprises requiring strict German data residency—it technically lags behind Scaleway's modern offering.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Innovation gap:</strong> Scaleway's <em>Serverless SQL</em> is a differentiator, allowing workloads to scale to zero and burst automatically. STACKIT relies on traditional 'flavor' switching (manual or scripted vertical scaling), which is a legacy paradigm for cloud-native applications.</li> <li><strong>Maturity & Ecosystem:</strong> Scaleway's documentation is comprehensive, and its Terraform provider is widely adopted. STACKIT's provider is active but shows signs of early maturity (e.g., issues with user role updates), and its public documentation often lacks specific technical depth (e.g., explicit SLA percentages or full extension lists).</li> <li><strong>DX & Friction:</strong> User reports indicate Scaleway has 'atrocious' support and aggressive fraud detection (locking accounts), which is a significant 'Soft Spec' negative. However, purely on technical capability (API breadth, extensions, autoscaling), Scaleway remains the more versatile platform. STACKIT is a 'safe' but feature-conservative choice.</li> </ul> <p>The score of <strong>-5</strong> reflects that STACKIT lacks the advanced automation (Serverless) and ecosystem maturity of Scaleway, placing it a tier below in terms of cloud-native capabilities.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (Score: 0).</strong> Both services rely on the open-source PostgreSQL engine. Migration between them (or to another provider) is standard via <code>pg_dump</code> / <code>pg_restore</code> or logical replication.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Scaleway:</strong> While its <em>Serverless</em> tier has minor proprietary behavior (IAM-based auth, no <code>LISTEN/NOTIFY</code>, connection pooling quirks), its standard provisioned instances are vanilla PostgreSQL.</li> <li><strong>STACKIT:</strong> Promotes 'No Vendor Lock-in' as a core value, using standard architectural patterns (likely Patroni-based clusters).</li> </ul> <p>There are no significant proprietary wrappers or non-standard APIs in either service that would create high exit costs beyond the standard friction of data egress.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for cost-conscious startups and general-purpose workloads. Its pricing structure is designed to lower barriers to entry, offering a <strong>Shared/Development tier</strong> that starts at a fraction of the cost of STACKIT's smallest instances. For production workloads, Scaleway's <strong>Dedicated (POP2)</strong> instances typically offer a <strong>1:4 vCPU-to-RAM ratio</strong> (e.g., 2 vCPU / 8 GB RAM), which fits database requirements better than STACKIT's observed <strong>1:2 ratio</strong> (e.g., 2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM) in the Flex tier. This means you often have to over-provision vCPUs on STACKIT just to get the required memory, significantly driving up costs.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway:</strong> Offers a 'pay-for-what-you-need' approach with very granular low-end options. A standard production instance (2 vCPU, 8GB RAM) costs approximately <strong>€103/month</strong>.</li><li><strong>STACKIT:</strong> Focuses on European data sovereignty and enterprise stability. A comparable configuration often requires sizing up to a 4 vCPU instance to get 8GB RAM (or accepting half the RAM), costing upwards of <strong>€168/month</strong>. The entry-level price is also much higher, with no meaningful free tier for small experiments.</li></ul><p>For a typical startup, STACKIT's premium for 'sovereignty' yields a significantly higher monthly bill compared to Scaleway's aggressive value pricing.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Managed MySQL is the superior general-purpose choice due to maturity, region support, and UX consistency.</strong></p><p>Scaleway (Service A) operates as a polished 'alternative hyperscaler.' It offers a standard, friction-free developer experience with mature Terraform providers, multi-region support, and granular control over storage performance (IOPS). Its High Availability (POP2) and Read Replica implementations are transparent and flexible.</p><p>STACKIT (Service B) is functional but exhibits the growing pains of a newer, niche provider. Its technical implementation suffers from a <em>split-brain management plane</em>: documentation explicitly warns that resources created via the Cloud Foundry marketplace cannot be managed via the STACKIT Portal/CLI, creating a significant 'trap' for operations teams. Furthermore, STACKIT is currently limited to a single region (Heilbronn), significantly reducing its versatility for non-DACH workloads compared to Scaleway's pan-European presence.</p><p>While STACKIT is 'GA' and stable for internal German enterprise use cases, it is <strong>noticeably inferior</strong> (-5) in terms of public cloud versatility, tooling maturity, and feature depth (e.g., lacking explicit IOPS tuning) compared to Scaleway.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (Score: 0).</strong></p><p>Both services are managed wrappers around standard open-source engines (MySQL for Scaleway, MariaDB for STACKIT). The underlying database protocols are compatible (MySQL wire protocol), and data portability is high via standard tools like <code>mysqldump</code>. Neither vendor injects proprietary extensions that would prevent a 'lift-and-shift' migration to another provider or self-hosted environment.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for cost-efficiency, particularly for startups and smaller workloads. Its dedicated <em>Play2</em> tier offers managed database instances starting as low as <strong>€10–15 per month</strong> (e.g., DB-PLAY2-PICO/NANO), making it one of the most affordable managed database options in the European market. The pricing model is granular, separating compute and storage, allowing for very low-cost entry points.</p>

<p><strong>STACKIT</strong>, backed by the Schwarz Group, targets the enterprise and data-sovereignty market. While it offers a robust Managed MariaDB service, its pricing reflects an enterprise focus. Entry-level <em>Single Node</em> instances are generally estimated to be <strong>2x–3x more expensive</strong> than Scaleway's equivalent 'Play' tier, and the platform heavily pushes <em>Replica</em> (High Availability) plans which can start around <strong>€70+/month</strong>. STACKIT lacks a 'micro' or 'hobbyist' tier comparable to Scaleway's PICO.</p>

<p>For a typical startup looking to minimize burn rate while retaining managed benefits, Scaleway provides significantly better value. STACKIT is a viable option only if strict German data sovereignty and enterprise-grade SLAs are the primary decision drivers over raw cost.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A) is noticeably superior to STACKIT (Service B) regarding platform maturity, version currency, and developer tooling.</strong></p> <p>While both services provide managed Redis instances with support for clustering and persistence, Scaleway delivers a more modern and agile product. Key differentiators include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Engine Versioning:</strong> Scaleway supports <strong>Redis 7.2.11</strong>, ensuring access to the latest performance improvements and functions (e.g., triggering functions, sharded Pub/Sub). STACKIT's documentation and release notes indicate a recent (Dec 2025) rollout of &quot;Redis 7&quot; (likely 7.0 base), placing it significantly behind the upstream release cycle.</li> <li><strong>Infrastructure Tooling:</strong> Scaleway offers a polished, HashiCorp-validated Terraform provider and a comprehensive CLI. STACKIT's Terraform support has historically been community-driven or in transition, which introduces friction for rigorous IaC adoption outside of Cloud Foundry.</li> <li><strong>Topology Options:</strong> Scaleway offers a clear path from Dev (Standalone) to Prod (HA) to Scale (Cluster), with explicit controls over node counts (3-6 for cluster). STACKIT's architecture is more opaque, often abstracted behind service plans (e.g., &quot;Replica Set&quot;) that may not offer the same granular control over sharding topology.</li> </ul> <p>STACKIT is a viable choice specifically for users within the Schwarz IT ecosystem or those heavily invested in Cloud Foundry, but for a general-purpose cloud architecture, it lacks the feature depth and velocity of Scaleway.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (Zero Lock-in):</strong> Both providers offer managed services wrapping the standard open-source Redis engine. There are no significant proprietary APIs or data formats introduced by either vendor.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Protocol Compatibility:</strong> Both services support the standard Redis Wire Protocol, allowing the use of any standard Redis client (redis-py, Jedis, etc.).</li> <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> Both allow for the import/export of RDB files (Snapshots), ensuring that data can be migrated to another provider or self-hosted instance with minimal effort.</li> <li><strong>Integration:</strong> While STACKIT favors the Open Service Broker API, this is an open standard. Scaleway uses standard REST APIs and Terraform. Switching costs are primarily operational (re-pointing DNS/IPs) rather than technical.</li> </ul><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Managed Redis</strong> is generally the more cost-effective option for startups, primarily due to its flexibility in High Availability (HA) configurations and aggressive base pricing. Scaleway allows users to deploy a <strong>2-node HA setup</strong> (Primary + Replica), whereas <strong>STACKIT's</strong> HA offering (termed 'Replica') typically provisions a <strong>3-node cluster</strong> by default. For a startup seeking redundancy without paying for a third node, Scaleway offers immediate savings.</p> <ul><li><strong>Scaleway:</strong> Positioning itself as a budget-friendly cloud provider, its standalone Redis instances start at approximately <strong>€29/month</strong> (€0.04/hour). The pricing model is simple, linear based on RAM/vCPU, and transparent.</li><li><strong>STACKIT:</strong> While competitive, STACKIT focuses on data sovereignty and enterprise compliance (German cloud). Its pricing is usage-based, but the structural requirement for 3 nodes to achieve the 'Replica' service level increases the minimum monthly spend for HA workloads compared to Scaleway.</li></ul> <p>For a typical startup workload that requires a balance of cost and reliability, Scaleway's ability to offer a lower entry point for both standalone and HA configurations gives it the edge.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Architecture & Scalability (The 'Big Data' Gap):</strong> The most critical technical differentiator is scaling strategy. <strong>STACKIT</strong> supports <em>Sharded Clusters</em>, enabling horizontal scaling for write-heavy or massive datasets (beyond the capacity of a single node). <strong>Scaleway</strong> is restricted to <em>Replica Sets</em>, forcing users to rely solely on Vertical Scaling (upgrading CPU/RAM) which hits a hard ceiling. For a NoSQL database often chosen specifically for scale, Scaleway's lack of native sharding support is a significant limitation.</p> <p><strong>Engine & Features:</strong> STACKIT explicitly provides the <strong>Enterprise Version</strong> of MongoDB, unlocking advanced security features (like granular auditing and LDAP integration) that are absent in Scaleway's <strong>Community Edition</strong> 7.0 offering. Furthermore, STACKIT's 'Flex' model allows users to scale storage independently of compute and choose storage performance tiers, offering granular architectural control that Scaleway's rigid node-type model lacks.</p> <p><strong>Developer Experience:</strong> Scaleway imposes a notable friction point: its Managed MongoDB is incompatible with Static NAT on Public Gateways, forcing developers to configure <em>SSH Bastions</em> for private network access—a clumsy pattern in modern cloud infrastructure. STACKIT provides a more seamless networking experience with standard ACLs and public IP options.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Open Standards:</strong> Both services utilize the standard MongoDB wire protocol and are compatible with official MongoDB drivers and tools (mongosh, Compass, Terraform). Migrating data out of either service is straightforward using standard tools like <code>mongodump</code> or <code>mongosync</code>.</p> <p><strong>Feature Nuance:</strong> While STACKIT offers 'Enterprise' features, utilizing them (e.g., specific audit log formats) creates a 'soft' lock-in where degrading to a Community Edition provider (like Scaleway or self-hosted) would result in feature loss. However, this is a choice rather than a platform constraint. Since the underlying data engine is identical and standard, the lock-in score remains neutral.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p>For a typical startup workload, <strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner in terms of pure cost efficiency. Its pricing model includes a distinct &quot;Shared&quot; (Play2) tier designed specifically for development and small-production workloads, with entry-level replica sets (3 nodes) costing approximately <strong>€25-€30/month</strong> (based on ~€0.036/node/hour). This provides High Availability (HA) at a price point that is hard to beat in the European market.</p>  <p><strong>StackIT</strong>, conversely, targets the Enterprise market (as part of the Schwarz Group). Its &quot;MongoDB Flex&quot; model is technically superior for scaling&mdash;allowing you to size storage independently of RAM/CPU&mdash;but this flexibility typically comes with a higher base price suited for mission-critical corporate data rather than lean startups. StackIT lacks a publicly promoted low-cost &quot;Shared&quot; tier, meaning users likely start at a Dedicated resource price point.</p>  <p><strong>Value for Money Verdict:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Scaleway</strong>: Best for Startups. You get managed HA (Replica Sets) for the price of a single dedicated node elsewhere. The 30-day trial reduces initial risk.</li> <li><strong>StackIT</strong>: Best for Compliance/Enterprise. If your &quot;value&quot; metric includes strict GDPR adherence and German data sovereignty with enterprise SLAs, StackIT justifies the premium, but for raw compute/dollar, it trails Scaleway.</li> </ul>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Architecture & Scalability:</strong> STACKIT Dremio represents a modern <em>Data Lakehouse</em> paradigm, whereas Scaleway Data Warehouse is a Managed ClickHouse instance with significant architectural constraints. Specifically, Scaleway's documentation (late 2025) confirms that <strong>sharding cannot be manually configured</strong> and the cluster operates in replica mode only. This limits total active dataset capacity to the vertical scale of a single node, which is a critical bottleneck for a service labeled 'Data Warehouse.' In contrast, STACKIT Dremio scales compute independently of storage (which lives on S3/Object Storage), allowing it to handle petabyte-scale datasets without the architectural ceiling imposed by Scaleway's replication-only model.</p> <p><strong>Versatility:</strong> Dremio excels at <em>Data Federation</em>. It can join data from an operational database with historical logs in S3 without moving data. Scaleway ClickHouse requires data to be ingested (ETL/ELT) into its storage format (MergeTree) to be queried effectively. While ClickHouse is faster for raw number-crunching on local data, Dremio's versatility in a modern, fragmented enterprise data landscape is superior.</p> <p><strong>Performance Trade-off:</strong> For pure, single-table query speed on structured data, ClickHouse is often unbeatable. However, Scaleway's managed offering constrains the engine's potential by removing distributed sharding capabilities. Dremio provides 'good enough' performance for interactive analytics over open formats (Iceberg) and offers superior governance via its Semantic Layer. The technical gap favors STACKIT (Service B) because it delivers a virtually unlimited, serverless-style analytics plane, whereas Scaleway (Service A) delivers a vertically-constrained database instance.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Data Gravity & Formats:</strong> STACKIT Dremio (Service B) scores significantly higher (lower lock-in) because it operates on the <em>Data Lakehouse</em> principle. Your data resides in object storage (S3-compatible) in open standard formats like <strong>Apache Iceberg</strong> or <strong>Parquet</strong>. Dremio is simply the compute engine; if you cancel the service, your data remains accessible, queryable, and intact in standard formats. You can switch to Spark, Trino, or another engine immediately.</p> <p><strong>Proprietary Ingest:</strong> Scaleway ClickHouse (Service A) requires data to be ingested into ClickHouse's internal binary formats (MergeTree files) attached to the compute nodes. While ClickHouse is open source, migrating away requires an active export/dump process (converting back to CSV/Parquet), which incurs egress costs and engineering friction. Scaleway's specific 'no sharding' architecture also means you are relying on their specific managed replication logic. STACKIT offers near-zero lock-in regarding the data layer.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Data Warehouse (ClickHouse)</strong> creates a more traditional, cost-effective path for startups needing high-performance analytics. Its model is primarily <em>provisioned</em>, meaning you pay a predictable hourly or monthly rate for a set amount of compute and storage (e.g., ~€0.14/hour for a basic node). This is advantageous for 24/7 workloads like dashboarding or real-time event logging, as you avoid the 'sticker shock' of consumption-based spikes. The <strong>Basic</strong> tier is accessible, while the <strong>Scale</strong> tier introduces autoscaling for larger demands.</p><p><strong>STACKIT Dremio</strong> operates on a <em>Data Lakehouse</em> model. You typically pay for <strong>Dremio Compute Units (DCUs)</strong> (often ~$0.20/DCU/hour) plus the underlying STACKIT infrastructure. While this allows for <em>scale-to-zero</em> efficiency (paying only when queries run), the unit cost is significantly higher than a raw ClickHouse node. For a startup with a small, always-on workload, Dremio's minimum hourly costs can quickly exceed Scaleway's flat rate. However, for sporadic querying of massive datasets stored cheaply in Object Storage, Dremio avoids the cost of duplicating data into high-performance disks.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Scaleway is the <strong>+6</strong> winner for typical startups due to its lower barrier to entry, predictable billing, and high performance-per-euro ratio for structured data. STACKIT Dremio is a premium, enterprise-grade solution best suited for organizations prioritizing data sovereignty and federated querying over raw cost efficiency.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Comparison: Niche Serverless vs. Enterprise Managed</strong></p><p>The technical gap between these services is defined by their intended use cases. <strong>STACKIT PostgreSQL Flex (Service B)</strong> is a robust, general-purpose relational database service suitable for primary storage in enterprise applications. It adheres to the standard PostgreSQL specification, meaning it supports complex queries, large transactions, and the vast ecosystem of PostgreSQL tools (e.g., pgAdmin, Tableau, Airbyte) without modification. Its 'Hard Specs' include a 3-node HA architecture and configurable backups, making it a reliable choice for production workloads requiring SLAs.</p><p><strong>Scaleway Serverless SQL (Service A)</strong> is technically impressive as a cost-optimization tool but falls short on versatility. While it offers true <em>scale-to-zero</em> (a feature B lacks), the trade-offs are significant. The service acts more like a 'Data API' than a full RDBMS, imposing hard limits such as a 1MB request size and blocking essential SQL features like <code>TEMPORARY TABLES</code>. These limitations break compatibility with many standard ORMs and ETL tools, forcing developers to architect around the platform's constraints. Consequently, Service B receives a higher score for being a fully capable database, whereas Service A is penalized for being a constrained subset of PostgreSQL, despite its autoscaling innovation.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Standards vs. Constraints</strong></p><p>While both services utilize the open-source PostgreSQL engine, <strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> introduces a form of 'architectural lock-in' through its proprietary proxy limitations. By disabling standard features like temporary tables and logical replication subscriptions, Scaleway forces applications to be written in a specific, non-standard way. Migrating an existing standard PostgreSQL application <em>to</em> Scaleway often requires code refactoring. Migrating <em>away</em> is technically easy (data dump), but the application logic developed for Scaleway might be overly simplistic or idiosyncratic.</p><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> acts as a standard Managed PostgreSQL provider. It supports the full wire protocol and feature set, ensuring 100% portability. An application running on STACKIT can be moved to AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL, or a self-hosted VM with zero code changes. Therefore, Service B offers significantly better portability and ecosystem compatibility.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Serverless SQL</strong> is the clear winner for <em>early-stage startups</em>, <em>development environments</em>, and <em>intermittent workloads</em> due to its ability to <strong>scale to zero</strong>. If your application is idle (e.g., at night or during early development), you pay only for storage (approx. €0.20/GB/month), whereas STACKIT requires a provisioned instance running 24/7.</p> <p>However, <strong>STACKIT PostgreSQL Flex</strong> becomes significantly more cost-effective for <strong>steady-state production workloads</strong>. Its entry-level instance (approx. 2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM) costs around <strong>€0.126/hour</strong> (~€90/month). In contrast, Scaleway charges approx. <strong>€0.136/hour</strong> for just 1 vCPU when active. This means for a database running 24/7, STACKIT offers <strong>double the compute resources for a lower price</strong>.</p> <p>For a &quot;typical startup workload&quot; (often characterized by low initial traffic and multiple non-production environments), Scaleway's model avoids the ~$90/month floor of STACKIT, earning it the efficiency recommendation. But as traffic stabilizes, migrating to STACKIT's provisioned model would yield substantial savings.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT offers a production-hardened Enterprise service, while Scaleway positions its offering as a lightweight "Essential".</strong></p> <p>The comparison reveals a significant maturity gap. STACKIT OpenSearch is designed as a primary data store for enterprise workloads, evidenced by its <strong>"Parachute"</strong> feature—a critical stability mechanism that proactively prevents node failure during storage exhaustion events (a common OpenSearch killer). Furthermore, STACKIT's backup schedule (every 4 hours) is aggressive and production-oriented.</p> <p>In contrast, Scaleway's OpenSearch is the flagship product for their new "Cloud Essentials" line (launched Q3/Q4 2025). Their own documentation describes this line as focusing on a <em>"minimal feature set"</em> for easy deployment. Crucially, strictly legal and technical documents often exclude "Cloud Essentials" products from the robust "Covered Service" SLA definitions that protect their mature databases like PostgreSQL. This relegates Scaleway's offering to Dev/Test or non-critical logging environments, whereas STACKIT is ready for mission-critical search workloads. STACKIT also wins on DevOps maturity with a stable Terraform provider, whereas Scaleway's IaC support for this specific new service is lagging.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards.</strong> Both services manage the open-source OpenSearch engine (primarily versions 2.x). There are no significant proprietary APIs or data formats introduced by either vendor. STACKIT's "Parachute" is an infrastructure-level management script that does not alter the underlying data compatibility. Migration out of either platform would simply involve a snapshot export or re-indexing, with no vendor-specific refactoring required.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Pricing Parity:</strong> The pricing comparison between <strong>Scaleway</strong> and <strong>STACKIT</strong> for Managed OpenSearch reveals a near-exact match in entry-level production costs, resulting in a score of <strong>0 (Parity)</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway</strong> charges approximately <strong>€0.099 per hour</strong> for its entry-level &quot;Shared&quot; node (2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM), which totals roughly <strong>€72.27 per month</strong>. This model is transparent and allows for granular scaling of storage and node types.</li><li><strong>STACKIT</strong> lists an entry-level &quot;General&quot; plan at <strong>€71.97 per month</strong>, which is effectively identical to Scaleway's offering. STACKIT simplifies the experience by bundling resources into plans, making it easy to predict monthly spend but slightly less granular than Scaleway's component-based pricing.</li></ul><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> For a typical startup workload, the choice between these two providers comes down to ecosystem preference (e.g., specific European region requirements or integration with other services) rather than raw cost, as the billing for OpenSearch is effectively the same.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Data Lab (Service A)</strong> is a specialized, high-performance tool for <em>Data Engineering</em> and <em>Distributed Computing</em>. It is not merely a notebook hosting service but a wrapper around a <strong>Managed Apache Spark Cluster</strong>. This allows users to process terabytes of data using distributed executors, leverage <strong>GPU acceleration via RAPIDS</strong>, and scale worker nodes up or down. It is a direct competitor to services like AWS EMR or Google Cloud Dataproc.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT Notebooks (Service B)</strong>, by comparison, operates as a standard <em>Data Science Workbench</em> (likely JupyterHub on Kubernetes) intended primarily as an entry point for their <strong>AI Model Serving</strong> and <strong>Data & AI</strong> platform. While excellent for data sovereignty and interactive Python/ML development, it lacks the inherent <strong>distributed processing engine</strong> (Spark) as a core, managed feature of the notebook service itself. To achieve parity with Scaleway's processing power, a STACKIT user would likely need to provision and manage their own Spark cluster on STACKIT Kubernetes Engine (SKE).</p> <p>The score of <strong>-4</strong> reflects this structural difference: STACKIT's offering is a standard IDE interface, whereas Scaleway's is a comprehensive distributed processing backend. For pure 'Notebook' usability, they are similar (0), but for the <em>technical capability</em> implied by 'Data Lab' (processing power), Scaleway is noticeably superior.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Score: 0 (Symmetrical Standards).</strong></p> <p>Both services are built entirely on open-source standards. <strong>Scaleway Data Lab</strong> is a standard <strong>Apache Spark</strong> and <strong>JupyterLab</strong> environment; code written there (PySpark, Scala) can be lifted and shifted to any other Spark cluster (AWS EMR, Databricks, or on-prem) with minimal to zero changes. <strong>STACKIT Notebooks</strong> relies on standard <strong>Jupyter</strong> notebooks and Python libraries. Neither vendor injects significant proprietary APIs or 'magic' SDKs into the compute runtime that would prevent migration. Data persistence in both cases typically relies on S3-compatible object storage, ensuring data portability.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Data Lab</strong> provides a significantly superior value proposition for startups and data science workloads compared to <strong>STACKIT</strong>. Scaleway offers a <em>fully managed</em> Apache Spark and JupyterLab environment where the cost is effectively just the price of the underlying compute instances (starting around <strong>€0.052/hour</strong> for a 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM 'Play2' notebook node). This 'managed service for the price of IaaS' model is highly cost-efficient.</p><p>In contrast, <strong>STACKIT</strong> does not currently list a standalone, first-party 'Managed Notebooks' service in its public pricing. Users typically must provision <strong>STACKIT Compute Engine</strong> instances (IaaS) and self-manage the Jupyter environment, or use 'STACKIT AI Model Serving' which is for inference, not development. A comparable General Purpose or Compute Optimized VM on STACKIT (e.g., c1.2 with 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) costs approximately <strong>€0.061/hour</strong>—roughly <strong>20% more expensive</strong> than Scaleway's equivalent, without the included managed software stack.</p><p>For a typical startup, Scaleway delivers a ready-to-use data platform for less money, whereas STACKIT requires higher engineering effort (DIY setup) and higher raw infrastructure costs, justified primarily for users requiring strict German data sovereignty.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ is the technically superior choice for production/enterprise workloads, while Scaleway NATS is a niche 'Serverless' wrapper with critical limitations.</strong></p><p>The comparison highlights a trade-off between <em>Control</em> and <em>Abstraction</em>, where Scaleway's abstraction currently removes too much utility:</p><ul><li><strong>Feature Completeness:</strong> STACKIT provides a standard RabbitMQ experience. You select a plan (e.g., <code>RabbitMQ-4.8.50-Replica</code>), get a 3-node cluster, and use it exactly as you would on-premise. It supports complex routing, dead-letter exchanges, and standard monitoring tools. Scaleway NATS, conversely, imposes artificial hard limits (latest docs cite <strong>50 streams per project</strong>), which is prohibitively low for microservices architectures that often require hundreds of streams.</li><li><strong>Observability & Ops:</strong> Scaleway explicitly notes that the <em>monitoring endpoint is not available</em>, forcing users to implement workarounds (like sidecars) to track metrics. STACKIT allows standard metric export and integrates with logging pipelines.</li><li><strong>Security & RBAC:</strong> STACKIT leverages standard RabbitMQ ACLs. Scaleway NATS uses a simplified credential model where one 'Account' context often lacks the granular user-level permissions (ACLs) required for strict service isolation.</li></ul><p>While Scaleway's <em>serverless billing</em> is attractive for sporadic workloads, STACKIT's <em>predictable performance</em> and lack of logical quotas make it the robust winner.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (0).</strong> Both services rely on open-source engines (NATS vs. RabbitMQ) and expose standard protocol endpoints. Migrating away from either service primarily involves instantiating a self-hosted cluster and updating connection strings.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway NATS:</strong> Uses standard NATS client libraries. The only 'lock-in' is the proprietary API used to generate the <code>.creds</code> (NKeys) file, but the underlying protocol is pure CNCF NATS.</li><li><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ:</strong> Uses standard AMQP 0-9-1. Migration is seamless using built-in RabbitMQ definitions export/import (Shovel/Federation).</li></ul><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway NATS</strong> offers a vastly superior cost model for startups through its serverless architecture. You are billed strictly on <strong>volume (€0.01/GB)</strong> and <strong>persistence (~€0.14/GB/month)</strong>. For a typical startup sending even hundreds of gigabytes of messages, the monthly bill would remain under €5. This model allows for scaling to zero costs when idle.</p><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong>, by contrast, utilizes a <strong>Provisioned</strong> model. You must select a Service Plan (e.g., Single Instance or Replica Cluster) and pay an hourly rate regardless of traffic. The smallest entry-level production-ready instance (Single Node, 2 vCPU) is estimated to cost roughly <strong>€40-€50/month</strong>, and a High Availability cluster (3 nodes) would exceed <strong>€100/month</strong>. While this model provides dedicated performance for enterprise workloads, it represents a significant 'creation tax' for early-stage projects.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Unless your application strictly requires RabbitMQ-specific protocols (AMQP), <strong>Scaleway NATS</strong> is the overwhelmingly more cost-effective choice, potentially saving 99% on the bill for early-stage workloads.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Comparison Summary:</strong> The comparison contrasts two fundamentally different paradigms: Scaleway's <em>Serverless Queueing</em> (SQS-compatible) versus STACKIT's <em>Managed Broker</em> (RabbitMQ).</p> <p><strong>Scaleway Queues (Service A)</strong> excels in <strong>Developer Experience (DX)</strong> for simple, decoupled microservices. Its serverless nature means developers can fire-and-forget without provisioning instances, and the usage-based pricing is ideal for sporadic workloads. However, it is held back by significant <strong>Hard Spec</strong> limitations, most notably the <strong>50 queues per project</strong> quota (confirmed late 2025 documentation) and a 256KB message size cap. These limits severely restrict its utility for complex microservice architectures where a 1:1 service-to-queue mapping is common.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ (Service B)</strong> is a <strong>Noticeably Superior</strong> technical offering for enterprise workloads. While it requires provisioning (selecting VM sizes), it provides the full power of the AMQP protocol, enabling sub-millisecond latency (via persistent connections/push) and complex routing logic that SQS cannot emulate. The ability to deploy Multi-AZ clusters ensures high availability, and the absence of arbitrary resource caps allows it to scale to thousands of queues. For any scenario requiring real-time messaging, ordering guarantees, or high throughput, STACKIT is the technically more capable platform.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Service B (STACKIT)</strong> is a pristine example of <strong>Zero Lock-in</strong> (+10). It provides a managed instance of RabbitMQ, the industry-standard open-source message broker. Users can export their configuration (definitions.json) and messages and migrate instantly to any other RabbitMQ provider (AWS MQ, CloudAMQP) or self-hosted Docker containers with zero code changes.</p> <p><strong>Service A (Scaleway)</strong> uses the <strong>AWS SQS Protocol</strong>. While this is a public API standard, it is a proprietary API owned by Amazon. Migrating <em>away</em> from Scaleway usually implies moving to AWS. Moving to a non-SQS provider (like RabbitMQ or Kafka) requires a complete rewrite of the application's messaging logic (replacing polling loops with consumers, changing SDKs). Thus, B offers absolute portability, while A ties you to a specific vendor's API design.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Queues</strong> utilizes a <em>serverless, pay-per-use</em> model based on the SQS protocol. This is significantly more cost-effective for typical startups and variable workloads because you only pay for the actual API requests (messages). Costs scale linearly with usage and drop to zero when idle.</p><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong> uses a <em>provisioned</em> model where you rent dedicated instances (Virtual Machines) to run the broker. Pricing starts at approximately <strong>€0.20/hour (~€144/month)</strong> for a high-availability replica set (Small). Even a single-node setup (if recommended for dev) would incur fixed hourly costs regardless of whether you process one message or a million.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> For a typical startup workload, Scaleway is drastically cheaper (likely cents vs. hundreds of Euros). STACKIT is only viable if you specifically require the RabbitMQ protocol (AMQP) or have a sustained, high-throughput workload that would make per-request billing expensive.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Comparison of Paradigms: Serverless Emulation vs. Managed Standard.</strong> The primary distinction lies in the architectural approach: <strong>Scaleway Topics</strong> is a serverless abstraction mimicking the AWS SNS API, while <strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong> is a managed cluster of the open-source RabbitMQ engine.</p> <p><strong>Feature Depth & Maturity:</strong> STACKIT (Service B) offers a technically superior foundation for general messaging. RabbitMQ is a battle-tested standard supporting complex routing, message persistence, and multiple protocols (AMQP, MQTT). In contrast, Scaleway Topics (Service A) is currently a limited implementation of the SNS protocol. Documentation reveals it supports only a subset of SNS subscribers (HTTP/S, Functions, Queues), lacking the broader ecosystem integrations (SMS, Mobile Push, Email) found in mature SNS implementations. This characterizes Scaleway Topics as an 'MVP' product suitable for simple webhook fan-out, whereas STACKIT RabbitMQ is an enterprise-grade broker.</p> <p><strong>Operational Model:</strong> Scaleway wins on <em>ease of adoption</em> for simple use cases due to its serverless nature—there are no instances to size or clusters to manage. However, for any scenario requiring message ordering, guaranteed delivery beyond simple retries, or complex routing logic, STACKIT is strictly necessary. The 'Serverless' advantage of Scaleway is outweighed by its feature incompleteness and the 'black box' nature of its proprietary backend compared to the transparent, standard behavior of STACKIT's RabbitMQ.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Open Standard vs. Proprietary Emulation.</strong> <strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong> relies on the open-source RabbitMQ engine. This represents near-zero lock-in; a user can export their definitions (queues, exchanges, bindings) and migrate to any other Cloud RabbitMQ provider, self-hosted Kubernetes cluster, or local docker container with no code changes. <strong>Scaleway Topics</strong> uses a proprietary in-house stack that emulates the AWS SNS API. While this theoretically allows migration to AWS, it locks the user into the 'AWS-style' API ecosystem. Moving from Scaleway Topics to a generic open-source solution (like Kafka or NATS) would require a complete code rewrite. Furthermore, because Scaleway's implementation is a subset of SNS, code written for Scaleway might work on AWS, but code written for AWS might not work on Scaleway, creating a 'fragile' compatibility layer.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p>The cost comparison highlights a fundamental architectural difference: <strong>Scaleway Topics</strong> acts as a serverless, AWS SNS-compatible Pub/Sub service, while <strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong> is a traditional managed broker service.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway Topics</strong> utilizes a <em>usage-based</em> model. You are billed purely on the <strong>Topic Volume</strong> (payload size x messages) that passes through the system. For a typical startup with sporadic or growing traffic, this results in near-zero costs initially. There are no minimum fees or idle cluster costs, making it significantly more capital-efficient for early-stage workloads.</li><li><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong> employs a <em>provisioned</em> model. You must select a service plan (e.g., <code>RabbitMQ-2.4.10-Single</code> or a 3-node <code>Replica</code> cluster) and pay an hourly rate for that capacity regardless of actual message traffic. The minimum entry price for a production-ready HA cluster is approximately <strong>€144/month</strong> (~€0.20/hour), and even a single non-HA node costs around <strong>€87/month</strong>.</li></ul><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> For a typical startup workload, <strong>Scaleway</strong> is drastically more cost-effective. You would need to push massive volumes of data through Scaleway Topics to approach the <em>base cost</em> of a STACKIT cluster. STACKIT is only viable if you have a strict requirement for the RabbitMQ protocol (AMQP) specifically, or if your sustained throughput is high enough to justify dedicated infrastructure.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Verdict: Scaleway is the comprehensive AI Platform; STACKIT is a compliant Model API.</strong></p> <p>As of early 2026, a significant functional gap exists between these services. Scaleway has effectively segmented its offering into two distinct products that cater to the full lifecycle of AI engineering:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Generative APIs:</strong> A direct equivalent to STACKIT's offering (Token-based, Serverless, Curated Catalog).</li> <li><strong>Managed Inference:</strong> A dedicated serving layer that allows engineers to bring <em>custom fine-tunes</em> and run them on private, isolated GPU infrastructure without managing the underlying container orchestration.</li> </ul> <p><strong>STACKIT AI Model Serving</strong>, while robust for standard use cases (e.g., "I need a Llama 3 chatbot"), strictly mirrors Scaleway's <em>Generative APIs</em>.

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway IAM (Service A) is technically superior due to its advanced policy engine.</strong></p> <p>The defining technical gap is the <strong>granularity of access control</strong>. Scaleway utilizes a policy model very similar to AWS IAM, allowing users to define permission sets with <strong>Common Expression Language (CEL) conditions</strong> (e.g., <em>"allow action X only if request.ip == 1.2.3.4"</em>). This level of control is essential for Zero Trust architectures and complex automation.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT IAM (Service B)</strong> operates on a more traditional <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> model. While it supports Custom Roles (lists of API permissions) and Service Accounts, it lacks the fine-grained, conditional policy logic found in Scaleway's platform IAM. Although STACKIT supports standard JSON policies for its <em>Object Storage</em> (S3 compatible), its <em>platform</em> resource management is coarser. Furthermore, Scaleway's Terraform provider and API maturity are significantly ahead, with STACKIT's IAM resources recently transitioning from experimental status.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Lock-in Risks.</strong></p> <p>Both services exhibit a similar lock-in profile:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Identity Entry:</strong> Both support <strong>Identity Federation</strong> via standard protocols (SAML 2.0 and OIDC), allowing you to manage identities in an external IdP (Okta, Entra ID, Keycloak).</li> <li><strong>Storage Auth:</strong> Both support standard <strong>S3 Bucket Policies</strong> (JSON), meaning storage access controls are portable to AWS, MinIO, or other S3-compatible systems.</li> <li><strong>Management API:</strong> Both use <strong>proprietary APIs</strong> for defining users, roles, and assignments. Scaleway's JSON policy format is a proprietary 'dialect' of AWS IAM (mental model portable, code not 1:1), while STACKIT uses a proprietary RBAC API wrapping its underlying stack (likely OpenStack/Cloud Foundry).</li> </ul> <p>Since neither exposes a standard open-source engine directly for <em>platform</em> authorization (e.g., direct Keystone access is not the primary interface), switching costs are equivalent: you would need to rewrite Terraform/IaC definitions for permissions in either case.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p>Both <strong>Scaleway</strong> and <strong>STACKIT</strong> follow the industry standard of offering Identity and Access Management (IAM) as a <strong>free, included service</strong> to facilitate the consumption of their paid resources (Compute, Storage, etc.). There are no direct licensing costs, per-seat fees, or premium SKUs for the native IAM functionalities in either cloud.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway IAM:</strong> Uses a straightforward, zero-cost model. Its defining characteristic is the presence of <strong>strict default quotas</strong> (e.g., 50 Users, 50 Groups, 50 Policies, 100 API Keys per Organization). While these are &quot;soft limits&quot; that can be raised by contacting support, they act as a functional ceiling for rapid self-service scaling. The model is highly cost-efficient for startups but requires manual intervention as the team grows beyond 50 members.</li><li><strong>STACKIT IAM:</strong> Also operates as a free core service but adopts a more complex, Google Cloud-like hierarchy involving <em>Customer Accounts</em> (billing/legal) and <em>Organizations/Projects</em> (technical resources). This separation allows for more sophisticated cost allocation (assigning different projects to different billing accounts) without incurring direct IAM costs. STACKIT does not publish restrictive &quot;50 user&quot; default limits, suggesting a more flexible initial scale.</li></ul><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Pricing is at <strong>parity (0)</strong> as both are free. STACKIT offers slightly better value for enterprises due to its hierarchical billing separation, while Scaleway offers simplicity for smaller teams.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p>The comparison between <strong>Scaleway Secret Manager</strong> and <strong>STACKIT Secrets Manager</strong> represents a classic 'Cloud Native Proprietary vs. Managed Open Standard' dichotomy. Scaleway offers a <strong>Standard</strong> implementation: a proprietary, secure, regionally replicated Key-Value store. It is effective, simple, and integrates well within the Scaleway console and IAM structure. It is the 'correct' choice for a pure Scaleway shop requiring simple API key storage.</p><p>However, <strong>STACKIT</strong> has made the strategic technical decision to offer <strong>Managed HashiCorp Vault</strong>. This is a <strong>technically superior</strong> paradigm for three reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Feature Depth:</strong> HashiCorp Vault is the de facto industry standard for secrets management. It natively supports advanced features that proprietary cloud tools rarely match, such as dynamic database credentials, transit encryption as a service, and highly granular path-based access control.</li><li><strong>Ecosystem Compatibility:</strong> By exposing the Vault API, STACKIT instantly supports thousands of existing tools, libraries, and integrations. A developer can use the standard <code>vault</code> CLI or the official HashiCorp Terraform provider to interact with STACKIT, whereas Scaleway requires provider-specific custom tooling.</li><li><strong>Operational Abstraction:</strong> Running self-hosted Vault is notoriously difficult (requiring unseal keys, HA storage backends, and rigorous security hardening). STACKIT abstracts this entirely, offering the 'Power of Vault' with the 'Ease of SaaS'.</li></ul><p>While Scaleway's solution is competent, STACKIT's offering is a managed instance of the best-in-class technology available in this domain. Consequently, STACKIT receives a high positive score for delivering a superior technical engine.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT achieves a perfect 'Zero Lock-in' score (+10).</strong> Because the service exposes the standard HashiCorp Vault API, there is effectively zero proprietary friction. A user can migrate <em>from</em> STACKIT <em>to</em> a self-hosted Vault, a Vault running on AWS/GCP, or HashiCorp's own HCP Cloud without rewriting a single line of application code; they simply change the <code>VAULT_ADDR</code> endpoint. <br><br><strong>Scaleway</strong>, conversely, utilizes a proprietary API. While they support the <em>External Secrets Operator</em> (which acts as a compatibility bridge for Kubernetes), direct application integration requires Scaleway-specific SDKs. Moving away from Scaleway would necessitate code refactoring to swap out the secret fetching logic. Thus, relative to STACKIT's universality, Scaleway has high friction.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Secret Manager</strong> utilizes a granular, consumption-based pricing model ideal for most startups. It charges a flat rate of <strong>€0.04 per secret version per month</strong> and <strong>€0.03 per 10,000 API calls</strong>. This model is highly cost-effective for standard use cases where applications cache secrets and request rates are moderate. For example, maintaining 100 secrets costs merely €4.00/month plus a negligible amount for API access.</p>

<p><strong>STACKIT Secrets Manager</strong> follows a tiered pricing model based on the number of secret versions, starting significantly higher at approximately <strong>€0.10 per version per month</strong> for the first 100 versions (based on hourly billing of ~€0.000139). The price per unit decreases as volume increases (e.g., €0.07 at 1k versions, €0.02 at 1M versions). While STACKIT does not list a separate fee for API operations—potentially offering savings for extremely high-traffic scenarios (e.g., aggressive polling without caching)—the base storage cost is <strong>2.5x higher</strong> than Scaleway for typical startup volumes.</p>

<p>For a typical startup with 50-200 secrets and standard access patterns, Scaleway is the clear winner on price. STACKIT only becomes competitive at massive scale (1 million+ versions) or in specific architectures where API request costs on Scaleway would exceed the storage price difference.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Score: -2 (STACKIT is slightly behind in general maturity, but ahead in critical infra-integration).</strong></p><p>This comparison highlights a classic trade-off: <strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> offers a mature, polished 'Application-Layer' KMS, while <strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> offers a more practical 'Infrastructure-Layer' KMS.</p><p>Scaleway's Key Manager is excellent if you are a developer building an app that needs to sign transactions or encrypt fields (Application-Level Encryption). Its APIs are stable, documented, and compliant with rigorous French (ANSSI) standards. However, for a Cloud Architect, Scaleway has a <strong>critical flaw</strong>: the lack of native 'Click-to-Encrypt' (SSE-KMS) for Object Storage. As of late 2025, you must still use 'Customer-Provided Keys' (SSE-C), requiring you to manage the key lifecycle and injection headers yourself. The roadmap places native SSE-KMS in <strong>Q2 2026</strong>, which is a significant delay for a table-stakes feature.</p><p>STACKIT KMS, while newer and having recently deprecated its v1beta API, solves this immediate infrastructure pain point. Its Terraform provider allows you to pass a KMS Key ID directly to Block Storage volumes, handling the encryption natively. While STACKIT's documentation is more fragmented (mix of PDFs and portal docs), its functional utility for a 'Lift and Shift' infrastructure project is higher today because it doesn't require the manual glue code that Scaleway's SSE-C demands.</p><p>Ultimately, STACKIT receives a slightly lower score (-2 relative to Scaleway) only because Scaleway's general platform maturity, UI polish, and API stability are years ahead. However, for specific storage encryption use cases, STACKIT is functionally superior right now.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Score: -5 (High Friction / Proprietary APIs).</strong></p><p>Both services impose significant vendor lock-in. Neither exposes a standard open interface like <strong>KMIP</strong> or the <strong>HashiCorp Vault API</strong> directly to the public internet for the managed service.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway:</strong> Uses a proprietary REST API. While the cryptographic primitives (AES-256-GCM, RSA) are standard, the management layer is unique to Scaleway. Migrating away requires decrypting all data (envelope encryption) and re-encrypting it elsewhere.</li><li><strong>STACKIT:</strong> Also uses a proprietary API (v1). Despite strong hints that STACKIT utilizes HashiCorp Vault on the backend (references to 'Transit Secrets Engine' in partner docs), the customer-facing interface is a STACKIT-specific wrapper. This negates the portability benefits of Vault unless you run your own self-hosted Vault on their compute.</li></ul><p>There is no 'Zero Lock-in' option here; choosing either binds your data's root of trust to that specific vendor's control plane.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Key Manager</strong> is the overwhelming winner for cost-conscious startups, primarily due to its disruptive pricing on key storage. While most hyperscalers and enterprise clouds charge approximately <strong>$1.00 (approx. €0.90) per key/month</strong>, Scaleway charges just <strong>€0.04 per key version/month</strong>. For a startup managing 10-20 keys, this is the difference between paying €0.40/month and €18.00/month for essentially the same utility.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway Pricing:</strong> Simple and ultra-low cost. You pay <strong>€0.04</strong> per active key version per month and <strong>€0.03</strong> per 10,000 cryptographic operations. There is no hidden complexity.</li><li><strong>STACKIT KMS Pricing:</strong> STACKIT operates on a transparent &quot;Pay-as-you-go&quot; model but relies on a downloadable PDF price list or calculator that is less accessible for quick comparison. Historically, STACKIT aligns closer to enterprise standards (similar to T-Systems or AWS pricing structures) rather than the low-cost developer-focused model of Scaleway. Without a specific published aggressive price point for KMS, it is safe to assume it follows the standard enterprise rate (~€1/key), making it significantly more expensive for small-scale usage.</li></ul><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> For a typical startup workload requiring standard encryption keys (AES/RSA) and moderate operation volumes, <strong>Scaleway</strong> offers unbeatable value. The cost difference in key storage (25x cheaper) makes Scaleway the clear choice unless specific German sovereign retail-sector compliance (STACKIT's niche) is a mandatory requirement.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Maturity Gap is the Deciding Factor:</strong> The technical score reflects a significant gap in production readiness. <strong>Scaleway Audit Trail</strong> is a polished, finished product. It fulfills the core requirement of 'Who did what?' with reliable retention, search, and export features that enterprises rely on for compliance audits today. Its integration with Scaleway Cockpit provides immediate visual value without configuration.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT Telemetry Router</strong>, while architecturally superior in its use of <em>streaming</em> and <em>OpenTelemetry</em> (OTel), is currently hampered by its <strong>v1alpha</strong> API status and the 'Public Preview' nature of its surrounding logging ecosystem. While Scaleway forces a 'Pull' model (scraping APIs or reading daily S3 dumps) which introduces latency, STACKIT's 'Push' model (streaming) is the preferred modern technical approach. However, until STACKIT's service reaches full GA stability, it cannot be recommended over Scaleway for critical compliance workloads. Scaleway is 'Old Reliable'; STACKIT is 'Next-Gen Beta'.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Latency:</strong> STACKIT wins on architecture (Streaming/Real-time) vs. Scaleway (Daily Batch/API Polling).</li> <li><strong>Stability:</strong> Scaleway wins decisively (GA vs Alpha).</li> <li><strong>DX:</strong> Scaleway offers a comprehensive UI/Console experience; STACKIT relies heavily on API/Terraform configuration for its router.</li> </ul><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (High Friction):</strong> Scaleway Audit Trail uses a proprietary API schema and JSON format. Exporting data to a third-party SIEM (like Splunk or Datadog) requires either waiting for daily S3 dumps or running a custom-built OpenTelemetry Collector with the <code>scwaudittrail</code> receiver to <em>scrape</em> their API. This creates a dependency on their specific implementation.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT (Open Standards):</strong> STACKIT's Telemetry Router and observability stack are built natively on <strong>OpenTelemetry (OTLP)</strong> and <strong>Grafana Loki</strong>. This means the data egress is standard-compliant by default. Moving away from STACKIT mainly involves pointing the OTLP stream to a new destination (e.g., a self-hosted Jaeger/Prometheus or a competitor's OTel endpoint), resulting in significantly lower switching costs and engineering overhead.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Both providers offer their audit logging and telemetry routing capabilities as foundational, free-of-charge services to ensure security and compliance.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway Audit Trail</strong> is explicitly <strong>free</strong>. It tracks all user and API activities across the Scaleway organization. There are no ingestion or management fees. The only potential cost arises if you choose to <strong>export</strong> these logs to Scaleway Object Storage, where standard storage rates (GB/month) apply for the bucket usage.</li><li><strong>STACKIT Telemetry Router / Audit Log</strong> functions similarly as a foundational compliance tool. STACKIT documents its Audit Log as an <strong>'Always on'</strong> service where admin activities are recorded by default. It provides a <strong>90-day history</strong> that is viewable, searchable, and downloadable without a separate subscription fee. While STACKIT offers paid 'Observability' and 'LogMe' services for application logs, the core platform Audit Log (handled by the Telemetry Router) is included in the platform usage.</li></ul><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Pricing is at <strong>parity</strong> (Score: 0). Both services remove the barrier to entry for security auditing by making the core control plane logging free. Users only pay for long-term archival storage if they choose to export the data.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway IAM (Service A) is technically superior due to its advanced policy engine.</strong></p> <p>The defining technical gap is the <strong>granularity of access control</strong>. Scaleway utilizes a policy model very similar to AWS IAM, allowing users to define permission sets with <strong>Common Expression Language (CEL) conditions</strong> (e.g., <em>"allow action X only if request.ip == 1.2.3.4"</em>). This level of control is essential for Zero Trust architectures and complex automation.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT IAM (Service B)</strong> operates on a more traditional <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> model. While it supports Custom Roles (lists of API permissions) and Service Accounts, it lacks the fine-grained, conditional policy logic found in Scaleway's platform IAM. Although STACKIT supports standard JSON policies for its <em>Object Storage</em> (S3 compatible), its <em>platform</em> resource management is coarser. Furthermore, Scaleway's Terraform provider and API maturity are significantly ahead, with STACKIT's IAM resources recently transitioning from experimental status.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Lock-in Risks.</strong></p> <p>Both services exhibit a similar lock-in profile:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Identity Entry:</strong> Both support <strong>Identity Federation</strong> via standard protocols (SAML 2.0 and OIDC), allowing you to manage identities in an external IdP (Okta, Entra ID, Keycloak).</li> <li><strong>Storage Auth:</strong> Both support standard <strong>S3 Bucket Policies</strong> (JSON), meaning storage access controls are portable to AWS, MinIO, or other S3-compatible systems.</li> <li><strong>Management API:</strong> Both use <strong>proprietary APIs</strong> for defining users, roles, and assignments. Scaleway's JSON policy format is a proprietary 'dialect' of AWS IAM (mental model portable, code not 1:1), while STACKIT uses a proprietary RBAC API wrapping its underlying stack (likely OpenStack/Cloud Foundry).</li> </ul> <p>Since neither exposes a standard open-source engine directly for <em>platform</em> authorization (e.g., direct Keystone access is not the primary interface), switching costs are equivalent: you would need to rewrite Terraform/IaC definitions for permissions in either case.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p>Both <strong>Scaleway</strong> and <strong>STACKIT</strong> follow the industry standard of offering Identity and Access Management (IAM) as a <strong>free, included service</strong> to facilitate the consumption of their paid resources (Compute, Storage, etc.). There are no direct licensing costs, per-seat fees, or premium SKUs for the native IAM functionalities in either cloud.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway IAM:</strong> Uses a straightforward, zero-cost model. Its defining characteristic is the presence of <strong>strict default quotas</strong> (e.g., 50 Users, 50 Groups, 50 Policies, 100 API Keys per Organization). While these are &quot;soft limits&quot; that can be raised by contacting support, they act as a functional ceiling for rapid self-service scaling. The model is highly cost-efficient for startups but requires manual intervention as the team grows beyond 50 members.</li><li><strong>STACKIT IAM:</strong> Also operates as a free core service but adopts a more complex, Google Cloud-like hierarchy involving <em>Customer Accounts</em> (billing/legal) and <em>Organizations/Projects</em> (technical resources). This separation allows for more sophisticated cost allocation (assigning different projects to different billing accounts) without incurring direct IAM costs. STACKIT does not publish restrictive &quot;50 user&quot; default limits, suggesting a more flexible initial scale.</li></ul><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Pricing is at <strong>parity (0)</strong> as both are free. STACKIT offers slightly better value for enterprises due to its hierarchical billing separation, while Scaleway offers simplicity for smaller teams.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p>The comparison between <strong>Scaleway Secret Manager</strong> and <strong>STACKIT Secrets Manager</strong> represents a classic 'Cloud Native Proprietary vs. Managed Open Standard' dichotomy. Scaleway offers a <strong>Standard</strong> implementation: a proprietary, secure, regionally replicated Key-Value store. It is effective, simple, and integrates well within the Scaleway console and IAM structure. It is the 'correct' choice for a pure Scaleway shop requiring simple API key storage.</p><p>However, <strong>STACKIT</strong> has made the strategic technical decision to offer <strong>Managed HashiCorp Vault</strong>. This is a <strong>technically superior</strong> paradigm for three reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Feature Depth:</strong> HashiCorp Vault is the de facto industry standard for secrets management. It natively supports advanced features that proprietary cloud tools rarely match, such as dynamic database credentials, transit encryption as a service, and highly granular path-based access control.</li><li><strong>Ecosystem Compatibility:</strong> By exposing the Vault API, STACKIT instantly supports thousands of existing tools, libraries, and integrations. A developer can use the standard <code>vault</code> CLI or the official HashiCorp Terraform provider to interact with STACKIT, whereas Scaleway requires provider-specific custom tooling.</li><li><strong>Operational Abstraction:</strong> Running self-hosted Vault is notoriously difficult (requiring unseal keys, HA storage backends, and rigorous security hardening). STACKIT abstracts this entirely, offering the 'Power of Vault' with the 'Ease of SaaS'.</li></ul><p>While Scaleway's solution is competent, STACKIT's offering is a managed instance of the best-in-class technology available in this domain. Consequently, STACKIT receives a high positive score for delivering a superior technical engine.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT achieves a perfect 'Zero Lock-in' score (+10).</strong> Because the service exposes the standard HashiCorp Vault API, there is effectively zero proprietary friction. A user can migrate <em>from</em> STACKIT <em>to</em> a self-hosted Vault, a Vault running on AWS/GCP, or HashiCorp's own HCP Cloud without rewriting a single line of application code; they simply change the <code>VAULT_ADDR</code> endpoint. <br><br><strong>Scaleway</strong>, conversely, utilizes a proprietary API. While they support the <em>External Secrets Operator</em> (which acts as a compatibility bridge for Kubernetes), direct application integration requires Scaleway-specific SDKs. Moving away from Scaleway would necessitate code refactoring to swap out the secret fetching logic. Thus, relative to STACKIT's universality, Scaleway has high friction.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Secret Manager</strong> utilizes a granular, consumption-based pricing model ideal for most startups. It charges a flat rate of <strong>€0.04 per secret version per month</strong> and <strong>€0.03 per 10,000 API calls</strong>. This model is highly cost-effective for standard use cases where applications cache secrets and request rates are moderate. For example, maintaining 100 secrets costs merely €4.00/month plus a negligible amount for API access.</p>

<p><strong>STACKIT Secrets Manager</strong> follows a tiered pricing model based on the number of secret versions, starting significantly higher at approximately <strong>€0.10 per version per month</strong> for the first 100 versions (based on hourly billing of ~€0.000139). The price per unit decreases as volume increases (e.g., €0.07 at 1k versions, €0.02 at 1M versions). While STACKIT does not list a separate fee for API operations—potentially offering savings for extremely high-traffic scenarios (e.g., aggressive polling without caching)—the base storage cost is <strong>2.5x higher</strong> than Scaleway for typical startup volumes.</p>

<p>For a typical startup with 50-200 secrets and standard access patterns, Scaleway is the clear winner on price. STACKIT only becomes competitive at massive scale (1 million+ versions) or in specific architectures where API request costs on Scaleway would exceed the storage price difference.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Maturity & Stability Gap:</strong> There is a clear maturity disparity between the two services. Scaleway Cockpit (Service A) is a polished, mature product that has been generally available for years (since 2023) and is now adding 'Day 2' features like data exporters. STACKIT Observability (Service B) is noticeably further behind, with its logging component only entering <em>Public Preview</em> in September 2025. This 'Preview' status for a pillar as critical as logging indicates Service B is not yet at full enterprise parity with Service A.</p> <p><strong>Feature Set & Data Safety:</strong> Service A provides a superior 'managed' experience. It is enabled by default, requires no configuration for internal resources, and includes an SLA that covers data reliability. Service B's documentation explicitly disclaims responsibility for telemetry backups ('No backup of telemetry data... takes place'), which is a significant technical risk for production environments. Furthermore, Service B lacks the automated 'zero-touch' dashboarding that Service A provides for its native resources.</p> <p><strong>Ecosystem & Versatility:</strong> While both utilize the standard Grafana/Mimir/Loki stack, Service A has evolved into a versatile data hub that can both ingest and <em>export</em> telemetry. Service B remains a closed loop (ingest-only), limiting its utility in complex multi-vendor architectures.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Asymmetrical Data Portability:</strong> While both services ingest data via open standards (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus Remote Write), they differ critically in <em>egress</em> capabilities. Scaleway (Service A) actively reduces lock-in by introducing a 'Data Exporter' (Beta 2026) that allows users to pipe their telemetry to third-party platforms like Datadog or other OTel endpoints. In contrast, STACKIT (Service B) documentation explicitly states that telemetry data is <strong>not exportable</strong> due to 'proprietary system architecture' and is intended solely for visualization within their managed Grafana instance. This creates a high-friction exit scenario where users can switch ingestion pointers (OTel) easily, but cannot migrate their historical data out of STACKIT, forcing a hard break in observability history.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Cockpit</strong> is drastically more cost-effective for startups and cloud-native workloads, largely because it monetizes <em>custom</em> external data while treating internal Scaleway monitoring as a loss leader (free feature). For a typical startup running on Scaleway, the bill is effectively <strong>€0/month</strong> unless they push custom business metrics or extend retention.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway Cockpit</strong> operates on a <em>Consumption-based</em> model. Ingestion from Scaleway resources is free. Custom metrics are billed at <strong>€0.15 per million samples</strong> and logs at <strong>€0.35 per GB</strong>. There is no minimum provisioning fee.</li><li><strong>STACKIT Observability</strong> operates on a <em>Provisioned Instance</em> model. You must deploy a service instance (e.g., Grafana/Prometheus/Loki stack), paid hourly. The entry-level &quot;Starter&quot; plan costs approximately <strong>€30&ndash;€70/month</strong> depending on the specific SKU (Monitoring vs. Full Observability).</li></ul><p>For a startup, paying ~€30/month merely to <em>have</em> a monitoring stack (STACKIT) is significantly more expensive than Scaleway's free default offering. STACKIT's model is better suited for enterprises requiring guaranteed resource isolation or strict data sovereignty compliance within the Schwarz Group ecosystem, but it lacks the elasticity and &quot;scale-to-zero&quot; cost advantage of Scaleway.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Maturity Gap is the Deciding Factor:</strong> As of February 2026, Scaleway Edge Services operates as a refined, mature layer atop their established infrastructure. It functions seamlessly as a 'toggle-on' accelerator for existing resources, handling SSL, WAF, and caching with minimal friction. In contrast, STACKIT CDN is effectively a brand-new service (GA Dec 2025). While functional for basic static asset delivery, it lacks the operational history and depth of integration found in Scaleway's offering.</p><p><strong>Feature Depth & Compute:</strong> Neither provider offers a true 'Edge Compute' platform (like Cloudflare Workers). Scaleway explicitly states no native integration between Edge Services and their regional Serverless Functions, and STACKIT lacks this capability entirely. However, Scaleway's WAF implementation (based on OWASP Core Rule Set) is more granular and battle-tested compared to STACKIT's simplified Block/Log approach.</p><p><strong>Developer Experience:</strong> Scaleway wins on UX. The ability to attach Edge Services directly to a bucket or LB via the console or Terraform with automated certificate management significantly reduces operational overhead. STACKIT requires managing the CDN distribution as a more distinct entity, reflecting its 'add-on' nature in the current maturity cycle.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards:</strong> Both services function as standard reverse-proxy CDNs. They do not support proprietary edge logic (e.g., VCL, Lua, or proprietary JS runtimes) that would create code-level lock-in. Switching away from either provider primarily involves updating DNS records and migrating SSL certificates. While Scaleway has a unique API wrapper, it does not trap data or logic, making portability high for both.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> employs a <em>subscription-based</em> model that is highly aggressive on price, making it significantly cheaper for most use cases, especially high-bandwidth workloads. Its <strong>Starter</strong> plan costs just <strong>€0.99/month</strong> and includes <strong>100GB</strong> of cache egress, effectively pricing data at ~€0.01/GB. The <strong>Professional</strong> plan (€12.99/mo) includes <strong>1TB</strong>, maintaining this low effective rate. Overage is charged at a mere <strong>€0.0135/GB</strong>, which is comparable to budget CDN providers (e.g., BunnyCDN) and far below typical cloud provider rates.</p><p><strong>STACKIT</strong> follows a traditional Enterprise <em>Pay-As-You-Go</em> model. While specific per-GB public pricing is opaque (snippets indicate variable hourly/traffic rates likely normalized to standard enterprise tiers around €0.05-€0.09/GB for Europe), it lacks the bundled value of Scaleway. For a startup consuming 1TB of data:</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway:</strong> €12.99/mo (Professional Plan, includes 1TB).</li><li><strong>STACKIT:</strong> Estimated ~€50.00/mo (assuming ~€0.05/GB standard EU rate).</li></ul><p>Scaleway's inclusion of WAF requests in higher tiers further improves its value proposition. STACKIT is only preferable for users who strictly refuse monthly base fees or require data residency specifically within the Schwarz Group ecosystem, but for pure cost efficiency, Scaleway is the clear winner.</p>
