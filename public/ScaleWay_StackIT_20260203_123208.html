        <h1>Cloud Service Provider Comparison</h1>
        <h2>ScaleWay vs StackIT</h2>
        <p>Generated at: 2026-02-03 12:32:08</p>

        <div class="summary-card">
            <h3>Overarching Summary</h3>
            
            <div><p>The comparison presents a distinct strategic dichotomy between agility and sovereignty. Scaleway (Service A) operates as a mature 'Cloud Challenger,' offering a full-stack, innovation-driven platform. It wins decisively on cost-efficiency (often 50-70% cheaper), developer experience, and modern features like Serverless, AI, and managed observability. However, its value proposition is compromised by recent concerns regarding data durability and platform stability. Conversely, STACKIT (Service B) positions itself as a 'Sovereign Enterprise Vault.' Built on open standards (OpenStack, Gardener, Vault), it offers superior portability and compliance (backed by the Schwarz Group), making it ideal for regulated German workloads. However, it suffers from significant maturity gaps (Alpha/Beta services), high friction, and an expensive enterprise pricing model. </p>
<p>Strategic Recommendation: Adopt Scaleway for the majority of greenfield applications, development environments, and cost-sensitive scale-outs, provided architecture includes application-level redundancy to mitigate provider reliability risks. Reserve STACKIT exclusively for workloads where strict German data sovereignty or OpenStack interoperability are non-negotiable requirements.</p></div>

            <h3>Domain-Specific Summaries</h3>
            
            
            <h4>Compute</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway is the superior choice for modern, agile infrastructure, offering advanced features like Serverless, AI supercomputing, and ARM architectures at aggressively low prices. It prioritizes innovation but locks users into a proprietary API. STACKIT is a conservative Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider; while it lacks feature depth and hardware diversity, it excels in portability due to its reliance on standard OpenStack APIs. STACKIT is suitable for standard enterprise VMs requiring compliance, while Scaleway is the definitive choice for performance-per-euro and technical breadth.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Storage</h4>
            <div><p>This domain highlights a critical trade-off between cost and safety. Scaleway offers a comprehensive, S3-compatible suite (including Glacier) at market-leading prices, but suffers from severe trust issues due to recent data durability incidents. STACKIT offers a technically superior and more reliable backend designed for enterprise compliance and SAP archival, but at a significant price premium and with higher operational friction. For mission-critical data retention, STACKIT is the safer bet; for ephemeral or replicable data, Scaleway offers unbeatable value.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Networking</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway delivers a mature, cloud-native networking experience with modern features like IPv6, managed gateways, and a simplified billing model that eliminates common bandwidth costs. It is user-friendly but proprietary. STACKIT adheres to standard OpenStack networking, offering high architectural portability but lagging in feature polish (e.g., IPv6 maturity) and retaining a traditional, potentially expensive ingress/egress billing model. Scaleway is operationally superior, while STACKIT favors hybrid-cloud interoperability.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Container Operations</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway Kapsule is the accessible, cost-effective choice, offering a free control plane and a polished user experience, though it has struggled with stability (cascading failures). STACKIT manages Kubernetes via the robust Gardener project, offering distinct advantages in fleet management and portability (such as hibernation). However, STACKIT's steep management fees and the current instability of its Beta registry service make it a difficult sell for general use unless the Gardener architecture is a specific strategic requirement.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Databases and Big Data</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway leads in innovation and developer experience, offering Serverless SQL, pgvector support, and cost-effective managed instances suitable for modern applications. STACKIT takes a rigid, enterprise-first approach, enforcing expensive High Availability clusters by default. While STACKIT excels in specific niches—such as Dremio for Data Lakehouses and a standards-compliant RabbitMQ service—Scaleway remains the more versatile and affordable platform for general-purpose database and analytics workloads.</p></div>
            
            <h4>AI Services</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway provides a comprehensive AI ecosystem, effectively bridging the gap between consuming APIs and managing custom model inference. It offers an excellent onboarding experience with free tiers and serverless flexibility. STACKIT focuses on a 'Model-as-a-Service' approach; while it lacks the tooling for easy custom model deployment, it is surprisingly cost-effective for high-volume inference on massive open-source models (e.g., Llama 70B), making it a viable specialist option for heavy inference workloads.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Security and Governance</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway offers a mature, production-ready suite with stable IAM, Audit Trails, and highly affordable Secret/Key management. It is integrated and ready for immediate use. STACKIT is currently in a transitional phase; while its use of the standard HashiCorp Vault API offers excellent portability, its core IAM is experimental, and its governance tools are immature (Alpha status). Scaleway is the reliable choice for immediate security needs, whereas STACKIT is positioned for future open-standard compliance.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Monitoring</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway Cockpit is a modern, serverless observability solution based on Grafana Mimir, offering zero-configuration ingestion and a pay-per-use model that is free for platform metrics. STACKIT relies on a legacy Managed Service Provider model, requiring users to provision and pay for dedicated observability instances. Scaleway is vastly superior for agility and cost, while STACKIT is only relevant for legacy architectures requiring dedicated resource isolation.</p></div>
            
            <h4>Edge and IoT</h4>
            <div><p>Scaleway provides a simple, highly affordable edge caching layer integrated with its storage and compute, ideal for accelerating internal resources. STACKIT offers a more robust, standalone CDN architecture capable of serving external origins with strict sovereignty features (geofencing). Choose Scaleway for simple app acceleration and cost control; choose STACKIT if the workload requires a true, origin-agnostic CDN with guaranteed European data residency.</p></div>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> is significantly ahead in terms of feature breadth and innovation. It has successfully transitioned from a bare-metal provider to a full-stack cloud with <strong>Serverless</strong>, <strong>Managed AI</strong>, and diverse compute architectures (ARM, RISC-V). Its <em>Instance Groups</em> support native autoscaling and auto-healing, features that are often more cumbersome to configure on raw OpenStack implementations.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> is a robust, 'boring' (in a good way) Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider. It scores lower technically because it lacks the advanced managed services and hardware agility of Scaleway. For example, while Scaleway offers 'Stardust' burstable instances and high-end AI supercomputing clusters, STACKIT focuses on standard general-purpose VMs. STACKIT's reliance on OpenStack is a double-edged sword: it offers standard compliance but inherits the complexity of OpenStack configuration (e.g., Heat templates) versus Scaleway's streamlined proprietary autoscalers. STACKIT is 'Noticeably Inferior' (-4) regarding feature innovation and hardware diversity but perfectly adequate for standard enterprise workloads.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Service B (STACKIT)</strong> achieves a perfect score for portability because it exposes standard <strong>OpenStack APIs</strong>. A user can manage STACKIT resources using the vanilla <code>openstack</code> CLI, standard Terraform OpenStack providers, or any tool compatible with Nova/Neutron. Moving <em>away</em> from STACKIT to another OpenStack provider (like OVH or a private cloud) requires minimal code refactoring.</p> <p><strong>Service A (Scaleway)</strong> uses a <strong>proprietary API</strong>. While it is developer-friendly and well-documented, it is unique to Scaleway. Migrating a complex infrastructure from Scaleway to another provider requires rewriting all orchestration scripts (Terraform, Ansible, API calls) from scratch. The contrast is stark: STACKIT embraces the industry standard, while Scaleway builds a walled garden.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for pure cost efficiency and startup value. Its pricing strategy is aggressive, offering some of the lowest compute rates in the European market. The <strong>Stardust</strong> instance (when available) is effectively free (~€0.10/month), and its <strong>DEV1</strong> and <strong>PLAY2</strong> ranges consistently undercut STACKIT by <strong>50% to 70%</strong> for comparable resources (vCPU/RAM). For example, a standard 2 vCPU / 4 GB RAM configuration costs approximately <strong>€19.71/month</strong> on Scaleway compared to roughly <strong>€43.67/month</strong> on STACKIT.</p><p><strong>STACKIT</strong> positions itself as a premium <em>Sovereign Cloud</em> provider (backed by the Schwarz Group), focusing on data sovereignty and German enterprise compliance rather than competing on raw infrastructure cost. While its billing is transparent and follows a standard hourly model, it lacks the aggressive low-end tiers and the cost-performance ratio of Scaleway's ARM or Development instances. STACKIT is a choice for compliance-heavy workloads, whereas Scaleway is the optimal choice for cost-conscious startups and general-purpose infrastructure.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Service B (STACKIT) is technically superior in the most critical metric for storage: Reliability.</strong> While Service A (Scaleway) theoretically wins on feature density—offering native S3 Glacier classes, Cross-Region Replication, and a more 'hyperscaler-like' API surface—its technical score is heavily penalized by severe <strong>data durability incidents</strong> reported in late 2023 and 2024.</p> <p>Multiple user reports and status updates confirm that Scaleway's implementation of Glacier transitions resulted in data loss for some customers, and the FR-PAR region suffered a month-long period of instability during architectural upgrades in late 2024. For an Object Storage service, losing files is a critical failure mode that negates feature benefits.</p> <p>Service B (STACKIT) adopts a more bifurcated architecture, splitting 'Standard Object Storage' and 'Compliant Archiving' into separate products. While this creates a <strong>Developer Experience (DX) friction</strong> (you cannot simply set a lifecycle rule to 'Glacier' in the same bucket as easily), it isolates the complexity and risk. STACKIT's backend appears more stable, utilizing a robust (likely Ceph-based) architecture that prioritizes consistency over feature velocity. Consequently, STACKIT receives a positive score for providing a dependable, albeit basic, storage utility, whereas Scaleway's 'advanced' features currently carry unacceptable operational risk.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Service B (STACKIT) has higher lock-in friction.</strong> Both services utilize the S3 API standard, ensuring basic data portability. However, Service A (Scaleway) adheres strictly to the AWS S3 model for storage classes, allowing users to use standard tools (like <code>aws s3api</code> or Terraform) to manage lifecycle policies that transition data to Cold storage (Glacier). Service B (STACKIT) separates its 'Archiving Service' from its standard 'Object Storage'. This means a user relying on STACKIT for long-term retention implements a proprietary or non-standard workflow to move data between these services, increasing the engineering effort required to migrate <em>away</em> to a standard S3 provider later.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Object Storage</strong> is the clear winner for cost-efficiency, positioning itself as a high-value 'challenger' cloud. Its pricing structure is aggressive: storage costs are approximately <strong>50% to 70% lower</strong> than STACKIT (depending on the class chosen, e.g., Multi-AZ vs. One Zone), and it uniquely includes <strong>unlimited API requests</strong> at no extra cost—a significant saving for active workloads. Scaleway also provides a recurring <strong>75 GB free egress allowance</strong>, which covers many small-to-medium use cases entirely.</p><p><strong>STACKIT Object Storage</strong> follows a more traditional, enterprise-tier pricing model comparable to AWS S3 Standard. With storage pricing estimated around <strong>€0.027/GB/mo</strong> (based on hourly rates), it is roughly <strong>2x more expensive</strong> than Scaleway's Multi-AZ tier and nearly <strong>4x more expensive</strong> than Scaleway's One Zone tier. STACKIT focuses on data sovereignty and enterprise compliance (Schwarz Group) rather than competing on raw price. For a typical startup or value-focused workload, STACKIT offers significantly lower value for money compared to Scaleway.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Comparison Summary:</strong> The comparison reveals a fundamental divergence in design philosophy. <strong>Scaleway Glacier</strong> is a true <em>Infrastructure-as-a-Service</em> (IaaS) primitive: a flexible, programmable storage class designed for builders. <strong>STACKIT Archiving</strong> is a <em>Compliance-as-a-Service</em> product: a rigid vault designed for auditors and SAP administrators. For the vast majority of cloud architects and developers, Scaleway is technically superior due to its interoperability.</p><ul><li><strong>Standards & Versatility:</strong> Scaleway uses the industry-standard S3 protocol. A developer can switch a flag in Terraform (e.g., <code>storage_class = "GLACIER"</code>) and the infrastructure adapts. STACKIT Archiving requires learning a proprietary REST API or implementing SAP-specific protocols, making it unusable for standard cloud-native backup workflows (e.g., storing Prometheus metrics or Postgres logs) without significant custom development.</li><li><strong>Developer Experience (DX):</strong> Scaleway integrates into the modern stack. Users can browse archives via CLI, set lifecycle policies, and retrieve data using standard libraries. STACKIT's service is a 'black box' designed to receive data streams from ERP systems and lock them away. The lack of standard tooling (rclone, s3cmd) support for the Archiving service is a major technical deficit for general utility.</li><li><strong>Performance & Friction:</strong> Scaleway offers a predictable, tiered retrieval model. STACKIT's focus on 'audit-proof' storage imposes friction by design (WORM), which, while valuable for legal compliance, is a hindrance for general technical operations (e.g., rotating backup snapshots).</li></ul><p><strong>Score Justification:</strong> The score of <strong>-6</strong> reflects that STACKIT Archiving is <em>Noticeably Inferior</em> for general cloud architecture use cases due to the lack of standard S3 compatibility and high barrier to entry (proprietary API), despite its niche strength in SAP environments.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A):</strong> <strong>+10 (Zero Lock-in).</strong> Scaleway utilizes the industry-standard S3 API. Data can be migrated out using any commodity tool (rclone, boto3) simply by issuing retrieval requests. The exit cost is purely bandwidth and retrieval fees, with zero technical refactoring required.</p><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B):</strong> <strong>-8 (High Proprietary Lock-in).</strong> The STACKIT Archiving Service uses a distinct, non-S3 REST API and proprietary SAP interfaces. Migrating data <em>out</em> of STACKIT Archiving would require writing custom scripts to interact with their specific API to retrieve objects, stripping away the proprietary metadata, and re-uploading to a new target. Furthermore, the WORM nature of the service may technically prevent deletion or modification until retention periods expire, creating a 'forced' lock-in based on legal configuration.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Glacier</strong> is the clear winner for cost-efficient archiving, offering a true "cold storage" price point of approximately <strong>€0.002 per GB/month</strong>. This is roughly <strong>10x cheaper</strong> than STACKIT's offering for equivalent storage volume. Scaleway also includes a generous <strong>75 GB free egress allowance</strong>, making it ideal for startups with typical backup or log retention needs.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway:</strong> Uses a classic deep archive model. You pay a rock-bottom price for storage but incur a <strong>€0.009/GB fee</strong> to restore data, with a retrieval delay of 24-48 hours. This model is perfect for data you rarely touch (Write Once, Read Never).</li><li><strong>STACKIT:</strong> Their "Archiving" service is positioned more as a compliance and enterprise feature (WORM, SAP integration) rather than a low-cost bit bucket. The pricing appears to align closer to standard object storage rates (~€0.027/GB/month), which is significantly more expensive for pure data hoarding capability.</li></ul><p>For a typical startup looking to store backups or logs cheaply, Scaleway provides massive value. STACKIT is only cost-competitive if the specific regulatory compliance features (like audit-proof SAP archiving) reduce other administrative overheads.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Performance & Architecture:</strong> STACKIT demonstrates a clear technical superiority in 'hard specs.' While Scaleway caps out at <strong>15,000 IOPS</strong> (Block 15K tier), STACKIT's 'Premium-Performance' classes scale up to <strong>40,000 IOPS</strong>, making it far more suitable for demanding IO-intensive databases. Furthermore, STACKIT offers <strong>Multi-AZ synchronous mirroring</strong> (Metro Volumes), a critical enterprise feature for zero-RPO disaster recovery that Scaleway lacks (Scaleway Block Storage is strictly Zonal with 3 intra-zone replicas). Scaleway's advice for Multi-AZ resilience is 'application-level replication,' which shifts the burden to the user.</p> <p><strong>Reliability & SLA:</strong> Scaleway's published SLA for Block Storage is <strong>99.9%</strong>, which is surprisingly low for a core cloud primitive (industry standard is typically 99.99%). Combined with recent community reports of instability in their storage layer (2024 incidents), this lowers their technical reliability score. STACKIT's architecture, leveraging multi-AZ mirroring, inherently supports higher availability tiers.</p> <p><strong>Summary:</strong> STACKIT is not just a 'Sovereign' alternative; it is technically more performant and resilient than Scaleway's offering, justifying a score of +7.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>API Standards:</strong> STACKIT is built directly on <strong>OpenStack Cinder</strong>. This means users can utilize standard OpenStack clients, libraries, and Terraform providers with minimal modification, facilitating easy migration to/from other OpenStack-based private or public clouds. Scaleway, while offering standard CSI drivers for Kubernetes, relies on a <strong>proprietary API</strong> for infrastructure management. Migrating away from Scaleway requires rewriting infrastructure-as-code definitions, whereas STACKIT adheres to a widely adopted open standard.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the overwhelming winner for typical startup workloads due to its aggressive <em>performance-per-euro</em> ratio. Its standard Block Storage offering provides <strong>5,000 IOPS</strong> and NVMe backing for approximately <strong>€0.086/GB/month</strong>. This 'batteries-included' approach means a 100GB database volume costs roughly €8.60/month with production-ready speeds.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong> utilizes a bifurcated model that separates <em>Capacity</em> from <em>Performance</em>. While its 'Premium-Capacity' tier is nominally cheaper at ~€0.066/GB/month, it lacks the high IOPS guarantees. To match Scaleway's 5,000 IOPS, a user must likely provision a specific 'Premium-Performance' class (e.g., Performance 6), which incurs a flat hourly fee (e.g., ~€0.10/hour or ~€73/month) on top of capacity costs. This makes STACKIT significantly more expensive for small-to-medium datasets requiring low latency.</p> <p>For a startup, Scaleway offers enterprise-grade speed at commodity prices, while STACKIT's model is geared towards large-scale enterprise deployments where paying flat fees for dedicated performance lanes is acceptable.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Performance & Architecture:</strong> STACKIT demonstrates a clear technical superiority in 'hard specs.' While Scaleway caps out at <strong>15,000 IOPS</strong> (Block 15K tier), STACKIT's 'Premium-Performance' classes scale up to <strong>40,000 IOPS</strong>, making it far more suitable for demanding IO-intensive databases. Furthermore, STACKIT offers <strong>Multi-AZ synchronous mirroring</strong> (Metro Volumes), a critical enterprise feature for zero-RPO disaster recovery that Scaleway lacks (Scaleway Block Storage is strictly Zonal with 3 intra-zone replicas). Scaleway's advice for Multi-AZ resilience is 'application-level replication,' which shifts the burden to the user.</p> <p><strong>Reliability & SLA:</strong> Scaleway's published SLA for Block Storage is <strong>99.9%</strong>, which is surprisingly low for a core cloud primitive (industry standard is typically 99.99%). Combined with recent community reports of instability in their storage layer (2024 incidents), this lowers their technical reliability score. STACKIT's architecture, leveraging multi-AZ mirroring, inherently supports higher availability tiers.</p> <p><strong>Summary:</strong> STACKIT is not just a 'Sovereign' alternative; it is technically more performant and resilient than Scaleway's offering, justifying a score of +7.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>API Standards:</strong> STACKIT is built directly on <strong>OpenStack Cinder</strong>. This means users can utilize standard OpenStack clients, libraries, and Terraform providers with minimal modification, facilitating easy migration to/from other OpenStack-based private or public clouds. Scaleway, while offering standard CSI drivers for Kubernetes, relies on a <strong>proprietary API</strong> for infrastructure management. Migrating away from Scaleway requires rewriting infrastructure-as-code definitions, whereas STACKIT adheres to a widely adopted open standard.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the overwhelming winner for typical startup workloads due to its aggressive <em>performance-per-euro</em> ratio. Its standard Block Storage offering provides <strong>5,000 IOPS</strong> and NVMe backing for approximately <strong>€0.086/GB/month</strong>. This 'batteries-included' approach means a 100GB database volume costs roughly €8.60/month with production-ready speeds.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong> utilizes a bifurcated model that separates <em>Capacity</em> from <em>Performance</em>. While its 'Premium-Capacity' tier is nominally cheaper at ~€0.066/GB/month, it lacks the high IOPS guarantees. To match Scaleway's 5,000 IOPS, a user must likely provision a specific 'Premium-Performance' class (e.g., Performance 6), which incurs a flat hourly fee (e.g., ~€0.10/hour or ~€73/month) on top of capacity costs. This makes STACKIT significantly more expensive for small-to-medium datasets requiring low latency.</p> <p>For a startup, Scaleway offers enterprise-grade speed at commodity prices, while STACKIT's model is geared towards large-scale enterprise deployments where paying flat fees for dedicated performance lanes is acceptable.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Maturity vs. Architecture:</strong> The primary differentiator is maturity. Service A (Scaleway) is a stable, GA product suitable for production workloads today. Service B (STACKIT) is in <strong>Beta</strong> (as of early 2026), which triggers a significant penalty in the 'Hard Specs' evaluation due to the lack of guaranteed SLAs and potential for breaking API changes. However, strictly looking at <em>architecture</em>, Service B is superior: its <strong>'Metro'</strong> design (synchronous mirroring across two Availability Zones) offers higher theoretical resilience than Service A's standard zonal model.</p> <p><strong>Feature Depth:</strong> Service B surprisingly outshines Service A in specific feature documentation, particularly regarding <strong>native snapshots</strong>. STACKIT explicitly documents snapshot scheduling and restoration APIs for File Storage, whereas Scaleway's documentation often points users toward Block Storage snapshots or generic backup strategies for files. Despite this feature advantage, the 'Beta' status acts as a critical anchor, dragging the score down to <strong>-4</strong> (Noticeably Inferior Maturity) rather than reflecting the positive architectural capabilities.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (NFS):</strong> Both services rely on the industry-standard <strong>NFSv4</strong> protocol for the data plane. This ensures that data is easily portable; migrating away from either provider simply involves mounting the target export and copying files (e.g., via rsync). There is no proprietary data format lock-in.</p> <p><strong>Management API:</strong> While both use proprietary control plane APIs (Scaleway API vs. STACKIT API) for provisioning, this is standard for managed infrastructure. Neither uses an open standard for the <em>management</em> layer (like the OpenStack Manila API) to a degree that would differentiate the lock-in score. Thus, the score remains <strong>0</strong>.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Summary:</strong> The comparison is heavily skewed because <strong>Scaleway does not offer a standard, commodity Managed NFS product</strong> for general users. To get NFS on Scaleway, you must either provision a Virtual Instance and attach Block Storage (DIY NFS Server) or opt for their premium &quot;Enterprise File Storage&quot; (NetApp) offering. <strong>STACKIT</strong>, by contrast, offers a native &quot;Professional File Storage&quot; (NFS) product accessible directly from their portal.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway (DIY/Enterprise):</strong> For a typical startup, the &quot;File Storage&quot; option is effectively <strong>DIY</strong>. You pay for a Compute Instance (e.g., &euro;0.03-&euro;0.10/hour) plus Block Storage (&euro;0.08-&euro;0.12/GB/month). While Block Storage itself is cheap, the overhead of paying for and managing a dedicated VM just to serve files makes it inefficient for small-to-medium datasets. The <strong>Enterprise File Storage</strong> (NetApp) option targets high-end use cases with likely higher commits.</li><li><strong>STACKIT (Managed NFS):</strong> STACKIT provides a true &quot;Service&quot; model for NFS. While public per-GB pricing is opaque without a login (customary for some enterprise-focused German providers), the architecture allows you to pay only for the storage service without the overhead of a compute node. This is significantly more value-for-money for teams that just need a <code>/mnt/data</code> mount point without maintaining a Linux server.</li></ul><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> <strong>STACKIT (+7)</strong> wins by default for simply <em>having</em> the product available as a managed service. Scaleway requires architectural workarounds (DIY) or protocol changes (using S3 Object Storage) to achieve similar cost-efficiency.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway VPC (Service A)</strong> is the technically superior product for general-purpose cloud networking in 2026 due to its maturity, feature completeness, and ease of use. The critical differentiator is <strong>IPv6 support</strong>: Scaleway provides native dual-stack networking by default, whereas STACKIT (Service B) is still relying on NAT64 translation with full GA planned for H1 2026. This is a significant gap for modern infrastructure.</p> <p>Furthermore, Scaleway's abstraction of the <em>Public Gateway</em> (handling NAT, DHCP, and Bastion duties transparently) offers a significantly better Developer Experience (DX) than STACKIT's raw OpenStack Router/Floating IP management, which often requires more manual configuration. Scaleway also extends its VPC into its Serverless ecosystem, allowing Functions to access private resources—a feature absent in STACKIT's networking suite which focuses primarily on VMs and Kubernetes.</p> <p>STACKIT receives a negative score not because it is 'broken', but because it lags in essential modern features (IPv6) and polish (managed NAT/Bastion) compared to the mature baseline of Scaleway. It represents a 'standard' Infrastructure-as-a-Service offering, while Scaleway has evolved into a 'managed' cloud platform.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> is explicitly built on <strong>OpenStack</strong> (Neutron), using standard APIs and constructs (Security Groups, Networks, Routers). This drastically reduces vendor lock-in; a user could migrate Terraform configurations to a private OpenStack cloud or another provider like OVH with minimal refactoring. The underlying architecture is open source.</p> <p><strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong>, while supporting open tools like Terraform and Ansible, utilizes a <strong>proprietary API</strong> and custom resource definitions (e.g., 'Public Gateway' objects) that have no direct equivalent in other clouds. Migrating away from Scaleway requires rewriting network orchestration logic to fit a new provider's specific API model. Therefore, STACKIT offers vastly superior portability.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for cost-conscious startups, particularly due to its <strong>free Private Networks (VPC)</strong> and bandwidth-tier pricing model. Instead of charging per GB for egress—which can be a 'hidden killer' for growing applications—Scaleway generally provides unmetered bandwidth capped by the instance's port speed or the Public Gateway tier (e.g., ~€0.02/h for basic). This allows for highly predictable budgeting.</p><p><strong>STACKIT</strong>, while offering a solid enterprise-grade European alternative, follows a more traditional hyperscaler model. Evidence suggests it charges for <strong>egress traffic</strong> (after a small 100GB allowance) at rates around €0.08/GB, and likely charges for Public IPs. For a startup pushing significant data, STACKIT's bandwidth costs could quickly exceed Scaleway's flat-rate infrastructure costs.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Scaleway receives a high positive score because its billing model actively removes the two most common cost barriers for startups: VPC management fees and per-GB data transfer costs.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Load Balancer (Service A)</strong> is the technically superior product for the vast majority of modern use cases due to its maturity and abstraction level. It operates as a true cloud-native service: users request an IP and a port, and the provider handles the scaling and redundancy invisibly. It supports modern protocols like <strong>HTTP/3</strong> and offers advanced features like <strong>multi-cloud backends</strong>, allowing it to front services hosted outside Scaleway.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT Load Balancer (Service B)</strong> relies on the <strong>OpenStack Octavia</strong> architecture. While 'standard,' this implementation is technically 'heavier' for the user. Configuring an NLB often results in the deployment of two visible Virtual Machines (Amphorae) into the customer's project to handle traffic (Active/Passive). This incurs a management mental load that Scaleway abstracts away. Furthermore, STACKIT's Layer 7 <strong>Application Load Balancer (ALB)</strong> is very new (GA Jan 2026), lacking the feature depth (e.g., HTTP/3) and battle-hardening of Scaleway's offering. The requirement to manage connectivity for external targets manually on STACKIT further widens the ease-of-use gap.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> scores highly for low lock-in because it is built directly on <strong>OpenStack Octavia</strong>. A user's Terraform configuration for STACKIT Load Balancers is conceptually and structurally very similar to standard OpenStack resources. This means migrating to another OpenStack-based provider (like OVHcloud or T-Systems) or an on-premise OpenStack cluster requires minimal architectural refactoring. <br><br><strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong>, while excellent, uses a proprietary API definition. Moving away from Scaleway requires rewriting the load balancer orchestration logic entirely to match the new provider's API. STACKIT's adherence to the open source Octavia standard provides a significant portability advantage.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p>When comparing <strong>Scaleway</strong> and <strong>STACKIT</strong> load balancers, the primary differentiator is the metering metric: <em>Bandwidth</em> vs. <em>Connections</em>.</p> <p><strong>Scaleway</strong> employs a <strong>Provisioned Bandwidth</strong> model. Their entry-level instance (LB-GP-S) costs approximately <strong>€0.016/hour (~€11.68/month)</strong> and includes <strong>200 Mbps of bandwidth with unlimited traffic</strong>. This is exceptionally high value for startups, as it removes the risk of 'bill shock' from data processing fees or egress charges. A 200 Mbps pipe can comfortably serve millions of web requests per month without incurring a single cent in variable costs.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong> uses a <strong>Provisioned Connections</strong> model. Their entry-level 'Essential' tier costs roughly <strong>€0.013/hour (~€9.50/month)</strong> but caps usage at <strong>10,000 concurrent connections</strong>. While the base price is slightly lower, the limit on concurrent connections is a harder ceiling for modern, websocket-heavy, or viral applications compared to Scaleway's bandwidth limit. Furthermore, while Scaleway explicitly bundles unlimited traffic, STACKIT follows a more traditional enterprise cloud model where data traffic generally incurs standard egress costs or limits, making the 'total cost of ownership' potentially higher for data-intensive workloads.</p> <p>For a typical startup seeking cost efficiency and predictability, <strong>Scaleway</strong> is the superior choice. The ~€2/month premium buys 'unlimited' data transfer and a generous throughput capacity, whereas STACKIT's model introduces a connection bottleneck that could require an expensive upgrade (to the €35/month tier) much sooner than expected.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A) is noticeably superior in feature completeness and developer experience compared to STACKIT (Service B).</strong></p> <p>The primary differentiator is the scope of the service. Scaleway acts as a full <strong>Registrar</strong> and DNS host, allowing users to purchase domains and configure zones in a single workflow. STACKIT DNS is primarily a <strong>Zone Manager</strong>. While STACKIT marketing mentions 'Domain Solutions', technical documentation and Terraform resources reveal it is treated as a separate, potentially manual or enterprise-managed tier, whereas Scaleway's registrar is fully automated.</p> <p>Critically, <strong>DNSSEC</strong> support demonstrates the maturity gap. Scaleway offers a simple 'one-click' activation and full API support for DNSSEC. STACKIT's public Terraform documentation lacks a native `dnssec_enabled` attribute for zones, forcing users to rely on support tickets or complex external configurations. Furthermore, Scaleway provides advanced traffic engineering features like <strong>GeoIP</strong> and <strong>Weighted Round Robin</strong> natively in the console, which are either absent or less documented in STACKIT's standard offering.</p> <p>STACKIT performs well as a basic, compliant Anycast DNS for enterprises already in the Schwarz ecosystem, but for a general technical comparison, it lacks the agility and feature depth of Scaleway.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (Score: 0).</strong> Both services adhere to the industry-standard <strong>BIND</strong> format for zone files. Users can easily export their DNS records from Scaleway or STACKIT and import them into any other provider (AWS Route53, Cloudflare, etc.) without data loss.</p> <p>While STACKIT is built on OpenStack Designate, it uses a proprietary wrapper in its Terraform provider (`stackit_dns_zone`) rather than the generic OpenStack provider, negating the specific API portability benefit. Consequently, neither vendor imposes significant lock-in beyond the standard friction of changing nameservers at the registrar level.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for cost-efficiency in the startup segment, primarily due to its <strong>bundled free tier</strong> model. If you register your domain with Scaleway, the DNS service is effectively free, including a generous allowance of 5 million queries per month. Even for external domains, the cost is roughly <strong>€0.88/month</strong> (billed hourly), which is highly competitive.</p>

<p><strong>STACKIT</strong> employs a <strong>provisioned model</strong> where you pay a flat hourly rate based on the number of records in the zone (starting at ~<strong>€1.94/month</strong> for 100 records). While this offers predictability and potentially unlimited queries (beneficial for very high-traffic sites), it represents a recurring cost for every single domain, which adds up quickly for startups managing multiple domains or microservices. The lack of a free tier makes it strictly more expensive for typical low-to-medium traffic workloads.</p>

<p>For a typical startup with &lt;5 million monthly queries per domain, Scaleway's cost is likely <strong>€0</strong>, whereas STACKIT would cost <strong>~€24/year</strong> per domain. STACKIT only becomes cost-effective if the workload exceeds the query limits of other providers significantly without exceeding the record limits.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway VPC (Service A)</strong> is the technically superior product for general-purpose cloud networking in 2026 due to its maturity, feature completeness, and ease of use. The critical differentiator is <strong>IPv6 support</strong>: Scaleway provides native dual-stack networking by default, whereas STACKIT (Service B) is still relying on NAT64 translation with full GA planned for H1 2026. This is a significant gap for modern infrastructure.</p> <p>Furthermore, Scaleway's abstraction of the <em>Public Gateway</em> (handling NAT, DHCP, and Bastion duties transparently) offers a significantly better Developer Experience (DX) than STACKIT's raw OpenStack Router/Floating IP management, which often requires more manual configuration. Scaleway also extends its VPC into its Serverless ecosystem, allowing Functions to access private resources—a feature absent in STACKIT's networking suite which focuses primarily on VMs and Kubernetes.</p> <p>STACKIT receives a negative score not because it is 'broken', but because it lags in essential modern features (IPv6) and polish (managed NAT/Bastion) compared to the mature baseline of Scaleway. It represents a 'standard' Infrastructure-as-a-Service offering, while Scaleway has evolved into a 'managed' cloud platform.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> is explicitly built on <strong>OpenStack</strong> (Neutron), using standard APIs and constructs (Security Groups, Networks, Routers). This drastically reduces vendor lock-in; a user could migrate Terraform configurations to a private OpenStack cloud or another provider like OVH with minimal refactoring. The underlying architecture is open source.</p> <p><strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong>, while supporting open tools like Terraform and Ansible, utilizes a <strong>proprietary API</strong> and custom resource definitions (e.g., 'Public Gateway' objects) that have no direct equivalent in other clouds. Migrating away from Scaleway requires rewriting network orchestration logic to fit a new provider's specific API model. Therefore, STACKIT offers vastly superior portability.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for cost-conscious startups, particularly due to its <strong>free Private Networks (VPC)</strong> and bandwidth-tier pricing model. Instead of charging per GB for egress—which can be a 'hidden killer' for growing applications—Scaleway generally provides unmetered bandwidth capped by the instance's port speed or the Public Gateway tier (e.g., ~€0.02/h for basic). This allows for highly predictable budgeting.</p><p><strong>STACKIT</strong>, while offering a solid enterprise-grade European alternative, follows a more traditional hyperscaler model. Evidence suggests it charges for <strong>egress traffic</strong> (after a small 100GB allowance) at rates around €0.08/GB, and likely charges for Public IPs. For a startup pushing significant data, STACKIT's bandwidth costs could quickly exceed Scaleway's flat-rate infrastructure costs.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Scaleway receives a high positive score because its billing model actively removes the two most common cost barriers for startups: VPC management fees and per-GB data transfer costs.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Load Balancer (Service A)</strong> is the technically superior product for the vast majority of modern use cases due to its maturity and abstraction level. It operates as a true cloud-native service: users request an IP and a port, and the provider handles the scaling and redundancy invisibly. It supports modern protocols like <strong>HTTP/3</strong> and offers advanced features like <strong>multi-cloud backends</strong>, allowing it to front services hosted outside Scaleway.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT Load Balancer (Service B)</strong> relies on the <strong>OpenStack Octavia</strong> architecture. While 'standard,' this implementation is technically 'heavier' for the user. Configuring an NLB often results in the deployment of two visible Virtual Machines (Amphorae) into the customer's project to handle traffic (Active/Passive). This incurs a management mental load that Scaleway abstracts away. Furthermore, STACKIT's Layer 7 <strong>Application Load Balancer (ALB)</strong> is very new (GA Jan 2026), lacking the feature depth (e.g., HTTP/3) and battle-hardening of Scaleway's offering. The requirement to manage connectivity for external targets manually on STACKIT further widens the ease-of-use gap.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> scores highly for low lock-in because it is built directly on <strong>OpenStack Octavia</strong>. A user's Terraform configuration for STACKIT Load Balancers is conceptually and structurally very similar to standard OpenStack resources. This means migrating to another OpenStack-based provider (like OVHcloud or T-Systems) or an on-premise OpenStack cluster requires minimal architectural refactoring. <br><br><strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong>, while excellent, uses a proprietary API definition. Moving away from Scaleway requires rewriting the load balancer orchestration logic entirely to match the new provider's API. STACKIT's adherence to the open source Octavia standard provides a significant portability advantage.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p>When comparing <strong>Scaleway</strong> and <strong>STACKIT</strong> load balancers, the primary differentiator is the metering metric: <em>Bandwidth</em> vs. <em>Connections</em>.</p> <p><strong>Scaleway</strong> employs a <strong>Provisioned Bandwidth</strong> model. Their entry-level instance (LB-GP-S) costs approximately <strong>€0.016/hour (~€11.68/month)</strong> and includes <strong>200 Mbps of bandwidth with unlimited traffic</strong>. This is exceptionally high value for startups, as it removes the risk of 'bill shock' from data processing fees or egress charges. A 200 Mbps pipe can comfortably serve millions of web requests per month without incurring a single cent in variable costs.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong> uses a <strong>Provisioned Connections</strong> model. Their entry-level 'Essential' tier costs roughly <strong>€0.013/hour (~€9.50/month)</strong> but caps usage at <strong>10,000 concurrent connections</strong>. While the base price is slightly lower, the limit on concurrent connections is a harder ceiling for modern, websocket-heavy, or viral applications compared to Scaleway's bandwidth limit. Furthermore, while Scaleway explicitly bundles unlimited traffic, STACKIT follows a more traditional enterprise cloud model where data traffic generally incurs standard egress costs or limits, making the 'total cost of ownership' potentially higher for data-intensive workloads.</p> <p>For a typical startup seeking cost efficiency and predictability, <strong>Scaleway</strong> is the superior choice. The ~€2/month premium buys 'unlimited' data transfer and a generous throughput capacity, whereas STACKIT's model introduces a connection bottleneck that could require an expensive upgrade (to the €35/month tier) much sooner than expected.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A) is noticeably superior in feature completeness and developer experience compared to STACKIT (Service B).</strong></p> <p>The primary differentiator is the scope of the service. Scaleway acts as a full <strong>Registrar</strong> and DNS host, allowing users to purchase domains and configure zones in a single workflow. STACKIT DNS is primarily a <strong>Zone Manager</strong>. While STACKIT marketing mentions 'Domain Solutions', technical documentation and Terraform resources reveal it is treated as a separate, potentially manual or enterprise-managed tier, whereas Scaleway's registrar is fully automated.</p> <p>Critically, <strong>DNSSEC</strong> support demonstrates the maturity gap. Scaleway offers a simple 'one-click' activation and full API support for DNSSEC. STACKIT's public Terraform documentation lacks a native `dnssec_enabled` attribute for zones, forcing users to rely on support tickets or complex external configurations. Furthermore, Scaleway provides advanced traffic engineering features like <strong>GeoIP</strong> and <strong>Weighted Round Robin</strong> natively in the console, which are either absent or less documented in STACKIT's standard offering.</p> <p>STACKIT performs well as a basic, compliant Anycast DNS for enterprises already in the Schwarz ecosystem, but for a general technical comparison, it lacks the agility and feature depth of Scaleway.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (Score: 0).</strong> Both services adhere to the industry-standard <strong>BIND</strong> format for zone files. Users can easily export their DNS records from Scaleway or STACKIT and import them into any other provider (AWS Route53, Cloudflare, etc.) without data loss.</p> <p>While STACKIT is built on OpenStack Designate, it uses a proprietary wrapper in its Terraform provider (`stackit_dns_zone`) rather than the generic OpenStack provider, negating the specific API portability benefit. Consequently, neither vendor imposes significant lock-in beyond the standard friction of changing nameservers at the registrar level.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for cost-efficiency in the startup segment, primarily due to its <strong>bundled free tier</strong> model. If you register your domain with Scaleway, the DNS service is effectively free, including a generous allowance of 5 million queries per month. Even for external domains, the cost is roughly <strong>€0.88/month</strong> (billed hourly), which is highly competitive.</p>

<p><strong>STACKIT</strong> employs a <strong>provisioned model</strong> where you pay a flat hourly rate based on the number of records in the zone (starting at ~<strong>€1.94/month</strong> for 100 records). While this offers predictability and potentially unlimited queries (beneficial for very high-traffic sites), it represents a recurring cost for every single domain, which adds up quickly for startups managing multiple domains or microservices. The lack of a free tier makes it strictly more expensive for typical low-to-medium traffic workloads.</p>

<p>For a typical startup with &lt;5 million monthly queries per domain, Scaleway's cost is likely <strong>€0</strong>, whereas STACKIT would cost <strong>~€24/year</strong> per domain. STACKIT only becomes cost-effective if the workload exceeds the query limits of other providers significantly without exceeding the record limits.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> offers a modern, cloud-native Site-to-Site VPN service that abstracts the underlying infrastructure, fitting the definition of a 'Managed Service.' Despite being in <strong>Public Beta</strong> (as of Dec 2025), it supports industry-standard features like <strong>BGP</strong>, <strong>IKEv2</strong>, and redundant tunnels with a native Terraform experience. This represents a significant leap in Developer Experience (DX) over legacy methods.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong>, conversely, relies on a 'VPN Appliance' approach. This is effectively a <strong>DIY solution</strong> where the vendor provides automation scripts (Terraform modules) to deploy a VM running VPN software. While functional, it lacks the benefits of a managed control plane (automatic patching, scaling, and simplified monitoring). It places the burden of reliability on the user.</p> <p>The score of <strong>+5</strong> reflects the gap between a true <strong>Managed PaaS</strong> (Scaleway) and a <strong>Scripted IaaS</strong> solution (STACKIT). Scaleway would score higher if it were fully GA with a proven track record, but the architectural superiority of the managed model is distinct.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Score: 0 (Symmetrical Standards).</strong></p> <p>Both services utilize standard <strong>IPsec/IKEv2</strong> protocols for the actual data transmission, meaning the client side (your on-prem router) configuration is identical regardless of the provider. </p> <ul><li><strong>Scaleway:</strong> Uses a proprietary API to <em>provision</em> the gateway, but the tunnel itself is standard. Moving away requires just pointing your router to a new endpoint.</li> <li><strong>STACKIT:</strong> Uses standard Open Source software (e.g., StrongSwan) on a VM. Migration is equally trivial (copying config files).</li></ul> <p>Since neither vendor enforces a proprietary client or tunneling protocol, and both interoperate with standard network gear (Cisco, Juniper, Ubiquiti), there is effectively <strong>zero vendor lock-in</strong> for the data plane.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the overwhelming winner for cost-conscious startups, particularly due to its <strong>unmetered traffic model</strong>. While most cloud providers charge for the VPN gateway instance <em>plus</em> per-GB data egress fees, Scaleway charges a flat hourly rate based on the <strong>bandwidth capacity</strong> of the gateway (e.g., ~€29.50/mo for 100 Mbps). You can fully saturate this link 24/7 without incurring a single cent in overage charges, making it exceptionally valuable for database replication, backups, or high-traffic secure tunnels.</p><p><strong>STACKIT</strong>, the cloud provider of the Schwarz Group (Lidl/Kaufland), targets enterprise customers with a focus on <strong>digital sovereignty</strong> and security. Its pricing is transparent but follows a traditional enterprise model—you pay for the compute/network resources and potentially traffic. While excellent for GDPR-critical workloads requiring German hosting, it lacks the aggressive value-for-money proposition of Scaleway's flat-rate pipe for generic startup needs.</p><p>For a typical startup workload, Scaleway's <strong>VGW-XXS</strong> or <strong>VGW-XS</strong> instances offer a predictable, low-cost entry point with no surprise bills, earning it a significantly higher efficiency score.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>The Gap: Innovation vs. Reliability.</strong> Scaleway Kapsule (Service A) is technically the more feature-rich platform, offering unique capabilities like <em>Kosmos</em> (which turns the control plane into a multi-cloud command center) and a slicker Developer Experience (DX). However, in the context of 'Hard Specs' for 2025-2026, Scaleway suffers significantly from recent, credible user reports of instability—specifically cascading failures where S3/Registry outages crippled Kubernetes operations. This violates the core promise of a managed service.</p> <p>STACKIT (Service B), while more utilitarian, is built on the industrial-strength <strong>Gardener</strong> project. This architecture provides it with distinct technical advantages in fleet management, such as the native ability to <strong>hibernate clusters</strong> (scale to zero cost) and robust auto-remediation. While STACKIT lacks the 'shiny' features of Kosmos, its architecture is cleaner and less prone to the proprietary 'glue' issues that seem to be plaguing Scaleway. The score of +2 reflects that while STACKIT is less 'feature-complete' in the serverless/hybrid domain, its architectural choice (Gardener) and stability focus make it the superior technical choice for <em>production</em> workloads where downtime is unacceptable, whereas Scaleway is currently better suited for development or non-critical hybrid experiments.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Gardener vs. Proprietary Wrapper.</strong> Scaleway (Service A) uses a standard CNCF-certified Kubernetes, meaning applications are portable. However, its unique selling point, <em>Kosmos</em>, introduces a form of architectural lock-in; relying on Scaleway's control plane to manage AWS/GCP nodes creates a dependency on their specific multi-cloud implementation (often using the Kilo CNI). STACKIT (Service B) is built directly on <strong>Gardener</strong>, an open-source project designed specifically to avoid lock-in by abstracting infrastructure provider details. STACKIT's clusters are arguably <em>more</em> portable because the management layer itself is an open standard adopted by multiple sovereign cloud providers. If you leave STACKIT, you can technically take your Gardener manifests elsewhere or revert to standard K8s with zero friction.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Kapsule</strong> is the clear winner for cost-efficiency, particularly for startups and small-to-medium workloads. The most significant differentiator is the <strong>Control Plane cost</strong>: Scaleway provides a <em>mutualized</em> (shared) control plane for <strong>free</strong>, whereas STACKIT charges a management fee of approximately <strong>€0.10/hour</strong> (roughly €72/month).

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Scaleway offers a reliable, production-ready service, while STACKIT is currently a volatile Beta product (as of late 2025/early 2026) struggling with basic stability.</p>

<p><strong>Maturity & Stability:</strong> Scaleway is the clear winner. Its registry is a mature platform component, recently upgraded for better resilience. STACKIT's offering, launched in Beta in June 2025, has faced harsh community feedback (e.g., resources taking hours to provision, timeouts in Terraform). For a critical dependency like a Container Registry, STACKIT's current instability is a major disqualifier for production workloads.</p>

<p><strong>Feature Set & UX:</strong> STACKIT utilizes <em>Harbor</em> under the hood, which theoretically provides superior features like native <em>pull-through caching</em> and <em>lifecycle retention policies</em>. Scaleway strangely lacks a native 'auto-delete old images' toggle, forcing users to implement a messy Serverless Function workaround. However, Scaleway's UX is polished and functional, whereas STACKIT's 'problem child' status indicates that even superior underlying software (Harbor) is being hampered by a poor control plane implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Score Justification:</strong> The score of <strong>-6</strong> reflects the gap between a mature GA service (Scaleway) and a Beta service with reported failures (STACKIT). While STACKIT's Harbor foundation is promising, the service is currently 'Noticeably Inferior' due to reliability risks.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Standard OCI):</strong> Scaleway uses a proprietary implementation that is OCI-compliant. Migrating <em>away</em> is standard (docker pull/push), but exporting configurations (permissions, webhooks) is vendor-specific. There is no 'export to Harbor' button.</p>
<p><strong>STACKIT (Managed Harbor):</strong> STACKIT uses <em>Harbor</em>, the CNCF standard for registries. This offers high portability: users can likely export Harbor-specific configurations (projects, policies, replication rules) and import them into any other Harbor instance (on-prem, AWS, or another provider). This reduces exit costs significantly compared to a proprietary wrapper.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Summary:</strong> <strong>STACKIT</strong> is currently the cost leader strictly because it is in a <strong>Free Beta</strong> phase as of early 2026. However, for long-term production planning, the two services are likely to reach price parity. <strong>Scaleway</strong> charges a standard market rate for private storage but offers a generous permanent free tier for public images.</p>

<p><strong>Scaleway Container Registry:</strong> Follows a classic cloud storage model. You pay <strong>€0.027/GB/month</strong> for private image storage. Data transfer is billed at <strong>€0.033/GB</strong> for inter-region traffic (intra-region is free). A standout feature is the <strong>75 GB free tier</strong> for public images, making it excellent for open-source projects. There are no fixed hourly management fees for the standard mutualized service.</p>

<p><strong>STACKIT Container Registry:</strong> Launched in mid-2025, this service remains in a <strong>Free Beta</strong> period where storage and management are currently cost-free. Once General Availability (GA) is reached, pricing is expected to align with STACKIT's Object Storage pricing (~<strong>€0.0266/GB/month</strong>), which effectively matches Scaleway's rates. Until then, it offers significant savings for startups willing to use a Beta service.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> For immediate cost savings on private repositories, <strong>STACKIT</strong> is superior (+8) due to its zero-cost Beta status. If stability and a proven non-beta SLA are required, Scaleway is a very affordable option with identical underlying storage economics.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> leads in technical versatility and innovation. Its inclusion of a <strong>Serverless SQL</strong> tier (capable of scaling to zero) and explicit support for modern extensions like <strong>pgvector</strong> positions it as a 'next-gen' cloud database suitable for both AI-native startups and cost-conscious developers. The platform feels more 'cloud-native' with advanced observability integrations.</p><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> takes a more conservative, robust approach. Its technical score is slightly lower not because of quality issues, but due to a narrower feature set. It lacks a true serverless offering and the depth of developer-centric extensions found in Scaleway. However, STACKIT excels in <strong>default resilience</strong>—provisioning a 3-node cluster (likely Patroni-based) by default is a significant stability advantage over Scaleway's default single-node offering. STACKIT is the superior choice for 'set-and-forget' enterprise compliance workloads, while Scaleway wins for modern application development.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> receives a positive score (lower lock-in) because it enforces a standard, provisioned PostgreSQL architecture. Users migrating away can simply <code>pg_dump</code> and restore to any other standard Postgres provider without re-architecting. <strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong>, while also based on open standards, introduces 'soft lock-in' via its <strong>Serverless SQL</strong> offering. Applications built to rely on its 'scale-to-zero' behavior and specific cold-start handling may require re-engineering or incur higher costs when moving to a standard provisioned provider.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is fundamentally more cost-effective for typical startup workloads, offering a tiered approach that separates <em>Shared</em> (Development) resources from <em>Dedicated</em> (General Purpose) resources. This allows startups to begin with very low costs (under €12/month) and scale up.</p><p><strong>STACKIT</strong> operates with an enterprise-focused pricing structure where even the smallest Single Instance (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) costs approximately <strong>€90/month</strong> (based on €0.126/hour). In stark contrast, Scaleway's comparable <strong>DB-DEV-M</strong> instance (3 vCPU, 4GB RAM) costs approximately <strong>€28/month</strong> (€0.038/hour). This makes STACKIT roughly <strong>3x more expensive</strong> for equivalent entry-level compute resources.</p><p>Furthermore, Scaleway offers a <strong>Serverless SQL</strong> option that can scale to zero, making it ideal for sporadic workloads, whereas STACKIT lacks a permanent free tier or a low-cost entry point. While STACKIT's High Availability (Replica) models are robust, the price premium for the base compute makes it difficult to recommend purely on a value-for-money basis compared to Scaleway's aggressive pricing.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A) is the technically superior product for general-purpose use cases.</strong> It offers a 'battery-included' experience with a fully mature Terraform provider, a clear and functional UI for sharding (Cluster mode), and explicit Service Level Agreements. Its hard limit of 6 nodes for managed clusters is a constraint, but it is a <em>known</em> and managed constraint.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT (Service B) lags significantly in transparency and platform maturity.</strong> The investigation revealed critical documentation quality issues, such as referencing 'Galera Cluster' (a MariaDB technology) in Redis architectural overviews, which undermines trust in the technical accuracy of their docs. Furthermore, while STACKIT claims to support Redis Cluster, their public pricing and configuration options strictly list 3-node 'Replica' sets (Sentinel-style HA), suggesting that true horizontal sharding is either a manual 'contact sales' feature or poorly exposed. The 'experimental' status of basic networking resources in their Terraform provider further confirms a lower level of technical readiness.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Zero Lock-in for both services.</strong> Both Scaleway and STACKIT utilize the standard, open-source Redis protocol. There are no indications of proprietary commands, modified engines, or 'black-box' APIs that would prevent a standard <code>BGSAVE</code> export or replication-based migration. Switching costs are limited strictly to data transfer and network reconfiguration (DNS/ACLs), which is standard for any infrastructure migration.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for cost-efficiency, offering a significantly lower barrier to entry and cheaper scaling for high-availability setups. Its pricing model is built for developers and startups, with a standalone instance starting around <strong>€0.0479/hour (~€35/month)</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway Pricing:</strong> Uses a granular model where you pay for the Main Node and significantly reduced rates for Additional Nodes. For example, a 3-node High Availability (HA) cluster with 2GB RAM costs approximately <strong>€0.103/hour</strong> (~€75/month).</li><li><strong>STACKIT Pricing:</strong> Focuses on enterprise compliance and sovereignty. Its entry-level 'Replica' (3-node HA) plan starts at roughly <strong>€0.20/hour</strong> (~€146/month). This is nearly <strong>double the cost</strong> of Scaleway's equivalent cluster configuration.</li><li><strong>Value Comparison:</strong> While STACKIT offers premium German data sovereignty suitable for strictly regulated industries, Scaleway provides a comparable European cloud experience at half the price. For a typical startup workload where strict 'Sovereign Cloud' certifications are not the primary driver, Scaleway offers far superior value for money.</li></ul>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT MongoDB Flex is noticeably superior due to its support for Sharding and Point-in-Time Recovery.</strong></p> <p>While Scaleway's offering is a polished, modern implementation of a standard MongoDB Replica Set (launched as a certified product in late 2024), it currently lacks the <strong>Horizontal Scaling</strong> capabilities found in STACKIT. STACKIT's inclusion of <em>Sharded Clusters</em> makes it viable for Tier-1, massive-scale applications that exceed the write capacity of a single primary node. Scaleway is restricted to vertical scaling within a Replica Set architecture.</p> <p>Furthermore, STACKIT explicitly markets <strong>Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)</strong>, a critical enterprise compliance feature that allows restoration to a specific second. Scaleway's documentation currently emphasizes volume snapshots, which typically offer coarser RPO (Recovery Point Objective). Both services benefit from the 'Certified by MongoDB' partnership, ensuring the underlying engine is robust, but STACKIT's feature set is currently more 'Enterprise Ready' for complex data needs.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (Official Partners).</strong></p> <p>Both Scaleway and STACKIT are part of the <strong>'Certified by MongoDB'</strong> DBaaS program (announced May 2024). This is a decisive factor for lock-in: unlike proprietary wrappers (e.g., Azure CosmosDB for MongoDB) that might emulate the API, these services run official MongoDB binaries with verified compatibility. This ensures 100% compatibility with standard MongoDB drivers, tools (mongodump/mongorestore), and the wider ecosystem. Migrating out of either service is as simple as a standard mongodump or replication sync to another MongoDB instance.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Managed MongoDB®</strong> is the clear winner for cost-efficiency and value, particularly for startups and typical production workloads. It utilizes the <strong>MongoDB Community Edition</strong>, which allows Scaleway to offer robust instance sizes (e.g., 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) at a fraction of the cost of competitors.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Entry-Level Disparity:</strong> Scaleway's 3-node HA cluster with 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM costs approximately <strong>€136/month</strong>. In stark contrast, STACKIT's comparable entry-level HA cluster (Flavor 1.1, likely 1 vCPU/1GB RAM) starts around <strong>€148/month</strong>. For a machine with similar specs to Scaleway's entry point (e.g., STACKIT Flavor 2.4), the cost jumps significantly (approx. €500+/month).</li> <li><strong>Licensing Model:</strong> STACKIT appears to position its service around the <strong>Enterprise version</strong> capabilities, which incurs a heavy premium. While valuable for large corporate entities requiring specific compliance integrations (like LDAP/Kerberos), this pricing model is hostile to typical startup budgets that do not require these features.</li> <li><strong>Development Costs:</strong> Scaleway allows for cost-effective single-node development instances starting around <strong>€78/month</strong> (for 2vCPU/4GB), whereas STACKIT's single-node instances, while having a lower absolute starting price (~€63/month), offer significantly fewer resources (1GB RAM), making them less viable for serious development work without upgrading to a much more expensive tier.</li> </ul> <p>Unless your workload strictly mandates MongoDB Enterprise Advanced features, Scaleway offers vastly superior hardware resources per euro spent.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Maturity & Reliability:</strong> STACKIT RabbitMQ (Service B) represents a mature, enterprise-grade implementation of a message broker. By offering explicit clustering options and adhering to standard availability expectations (High Availability), it vastly outperforms Scaleway NATS (Service A) in reliability commitments. Scaleway's SLA of <strong>99.0%</strong> is significantly below the industry standard (typically 99.9%+) for cloud messaging, and the service imposes 'hard' limits like a single set of credentials per account, which renders it unsuitable for complex multi-tenant or secure microservices architectures.</p> <p><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Service A (Scaleway) attempts to simplify operations via a serverless model, but introduces technical debt through its opacity. The inability to access the native NATS monitoring endpoint forces developers to engineer custom solutions for autoscaling logic. Service B (STACKIT) provides a transparent, standard RabbitMQ experience where existing tools, plugins, and operational playbooks apply directly without modification.</p> <p><strong>Feature Depth:</strong> While NATS is technically a 'next-gen' protocol compared to AMQP, Scaleway's implementation cripples its potential with storage quotas (referenced as low as 300MB for persistence in some contexts) and lack of granular security controls. STACKIT delivers the full breadth of RabbitMQ features, including Federation and Exchange-to-Exchange bindings, making it the noticeably superior choice for production workloads.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>API & Standards:</strong> STACKIT RabbitMQ (Service B) is a standard implementation of the open-source RabbitMQ broker. Users can migrate data in or out using standard AMQP tools (e.g., <code>rabbitmqadmin export</code>) and connect using any standard SDK. The platform imposes minimal vendor-specific constraints.</p> <p><strong>Proprietary Friction in A:</strong> Scaleway NATS (Service A) introduces higher friction due to its specific authentication architecture. It enforces the use of NKeys via a proprietary API flow and limits the account to a single identity, deviating from how self-hosted NATS clusters (which support flexible authentication schemes and multi-user accounts) typically operate. Migrating <em>away</em> from Scaleway would require refactoring application security logic to handle standard NATS authentication, and migrating <em>to</em> Scaleway often requires stripping away complex ACLs used in other environments.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway NATS</strong> offers a modern, cloud-native pricing model that is vastly superior for startups and variable workloads. It utilizes a <em>pay-per-use</em> mechanism where users are billed primarily for the volume of data transferred (approx. <strong>€0.01/GB</strong>) and data stored (approx. <strong>€0.14/GB/month</strong>). This allows a startup to run a production-grade messaging system for mere pennies per month during the early growth phase.</p><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong>, in contrast, adopts a traditional enterprise pricing strategy. Its offering appears to default to a <strong>3-node High Availability cluster</strong> (Replica plans), with the entry-level plan costing approximately <strong>€0.20/hour</strong>. This translates to a minimum monthly spend of roughly <strong>€146</strong>, regardless of whether you send one message or a million. While this model provides excellent reliability and predictability for established enterprises, it presents a significant financial barrier for smaller projects.</p><p>For a typical startup, the cost difference is effectively infinite in percentage terms (e.g., €0.05 vs €146.00). Scaleway is the clear winner for cost efficiency unless the specific features of RabbitMQ (complex routing, AMQP) are strictly required over NATS.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ (Service B) is technically superior to Scaleway Queues (Service A) for production workloads due to feature completeness and protocol adherence.</strong></p> <p>While Scaleway Queues offers an attractive serverless billing model, its technical implementation relies on a proprietary emulation of the AWS SQS standard that is currently missing critical primitives. Specifically, the lack of <code>MessageGroupId</code> support in FIFO queues renders them unable to scale consumers horizontally while maintaining order (a standard SQS capability), effectively bottlenecking throughput to a single consumer. Additionally, the absence of <code>DelaySeconds</code> removes native support for delayed retries and scheduled tasks, forcing developers to implement complex client-side workarounds.</p> <p>In contrast, STACKIT provides a genuine, fully compliant RabbitMQ cluster. This enables low-latency, persistent TCP-based messaging (AMQP) which fundamentally outperforms the HTTP polling model of Scaleway Queues in high-throughput scenarios. STACKIT supports complex routing logic (Topic/Headers exchanges) and multiple protocols (MQTT/STOMP) that Scaleway completely lacks. The only area where Scaleway leads is in 'idle cost' for sporadic workloads, but for any serious messaging architecture, STACKIT's feature parity with the industry standard makes it the robust choice.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B) offers Zero Lock-in (+10)</strong> as it provides a standard, managed RabbitMQ instance. Users can migrate their configuration and application code to any other RabbitMQ provider (AWS MQ, CloudAMQP, self-hosted) without changing a single line of logic. <strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> uses the <strong>SQS API</strong>, which is technically a proprietary AWS interface. While widely adopted, Scaleway's <em>partial implementation</em> creates a unique form of 'reverse lock-in': code written for Scaleway's limited feature set will run on AWS, but standard AWS SQS code (using Delays or MessageGroups) will fail on Scaleway, creating friction during migration.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Queues</strong> (A) utilizes a truly <strong>serverless, usage-based model</strong>. Users pay strictly for the volume of messages and data processed, with no idle costs. While specific per-request pricing for the SQS-compatible Queues product can be intricate (often billed by data volume, e.g., €0.01/GB, or per million messages depending on the specific protocol selected like NATS vs SQS), the cost for a typical startup workload is negligible—often costing pennies per month.</p><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong> (B) follows a <strong>provisioned, enterprise-focused model</strong>. The service appears to enforce High Availability (HA) by default, with the smallest listed plan (<code>RabbitMQ-1.2.10-Replica</code>) costing approximately <strong>€0.20/hour</strong>, or roughly <strong>€146/month</strong>. This creates a significant barrier to entry for smaller projects or development environments compared to Scaleway's scale-to-zero approach.</p><p>For a startup, Scaleway is the overwhelming winner for cost efficiency, offering a practically free entry point. STACKIT is priced for enterprise production workloads requiring guaranteed resource isolation and HA from day one, making it significantly more expensive for general-purpose use.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p>The comparison represents a clash between a <strong>Serverless SNS Emulation</strong> (Scaleway) and a <strong>Managed Open-Source Broker</strong> (STACKIT). STACKIT RabbitMQ receives a positive score (+6) because it provides a technically superior foundation for mission-critical messaging, despite its provisioning friction.</p> <p><strong>Architecture & Reliability:</strong> Scaleway's offering is severely hampered by its <strong>99% SLA</strong> and strict 'hard limits' (100MB total storage per project, 256KB max message size). These constraints relegate it to non-critical notification tasks rather than robust enterprise message bus workloads. STACKIT, conversely, offers standard <strong>3-node HA clusters</strong> with persistent storage that scales with disk size, making it suitable for durable, high-throughput architectures.</p> <p><strong>Versatility:</strong> Scaleway is limited to a <em>Push-based</em> model (Webhooks/Functions) via the SNS API. It cannot handle complex routing, message replay, or long-polling consumers effectively. STACKIT supports the full <strong>RabbitMQ protocol suite (AMQP, MQTT, STOMP)</strong>, allowing for diverse patterns like 'Request/Reply', 'Work Queues', and IoT ingestion, which Scaleway simply cannot support.</p> <p><strong>Developer Experience:</strong> While Scaleway wins on <em>speed of access</em> (serverless instantiation), the technical ceiling is too low for serious applications. STACKIT's sluggish provisioning (user reports of hours) is a significant 'Soft Spec' negative, but once running, the service offers the industry-standard reliability and feature set of RabbitMQ, which objectively outperforms a limited SNS clone.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ (+8):</strong> Represents near-zero lock-in. It is a managed instance of the open-source RabbitMQ engine. Users can export definitions/messages and migrate to any other Cloud RabbitMQ (AWS MQ, CloudAMQP) or self-hosted Docker container with no code changes, as it uses standard AMQP drivers.</p> <p><strong>Scaleway Topics (0):</strong> Uses the <strong>AWS SNS API</strong>. While this theoretically allows migration to AWS, it creates a dependency on a <em>proprietary API standard</em> rather than an open protocol. Migrating <em>away</em> from Scaleway to AWS is easy, but migrating to a generic open-source alternative (like NATS or Kafka) would require a code rewrite. Furthermore, Scaleway's 'in-house implementation' does not support the full AWS SNS feature set, potentially creating 'implementation lock-in' where code written for Scaleway works on AWS, but code written for AWS might break on Scaleway.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p>The cost comparison between <strong>Scaleway Topics and Events</strong> and <strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong> reveals a fundamental difference between <em>Serverless</em> and <em>Provisioned</em> architectures, with Scaleway being the clear winner for cost-efficiency in startup scenarios.</p>

<p><strong>Scaleway Topics and Events</strong> (part of their Messaging & Queuing suite, compatible with SNS/SQS) operates on a <strong>Serverless Pay-per-Use</strong> model. Billing is primarily driven by <strong>topic volume</strong> (total size of messages processed) and request counts. This means a startup with low or bursty traffic pays effectively nothing (often pennies per month), as there are no costs for idle time. The service scales automatically without financial commitment, making it ideal for decoupled microservices architectures.</p>

<p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong>, conversely, is a fully <strong>Managed Service</strong> that provisions dedicated infrastructure. The pricing model is <strong>Hourly</strong> based on the instance size. Crucially, STACKIT prioritizes reliability, with their entry-level plans often including <strong>High Availability (Replica)</strong> clusters by default. While this offers excellent stability, it creates a high minimum monthly cost (approx. <strong>€146/month</strong> for the smallest HA plan at ~€0.20/hour). There is no 'pause' feature; you pay for the cluster existence 24/7 regardless of message throughput.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> For a typical startup workload, STACKIT's entry price is prohibitively high compared to Scaleway's near-zero starting cost. STACKIT is priced for enterprise environments requiring guaranteed resource isolation and HA SLAs from day one, whereas Scaleway offers the flexibility to start free and pay as you grow.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT OpenSearch is technically superior for power users requiring granular control, while Scaleway prioritizes ease of use.</strong></p>
<p>The comparison centers on the trade-off between <em>simplicity</em> and <em>configurability</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> positions its offering as "Cloud Essentials," a managed wrapper designed to abstract complexity. While this offers an excellent developer experience (DX) for rapid provisioning, it limits advanced tuning. The distinction between "Shared" and "Dedicated" nodes is less granular than STACKIT's detailed sizing options.</li>
<li><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> provides a more traditional managed service model that exposes detailed plan sizes (e.g., <code>OpenSearch-16.64.1000</code> for 16 vCPU, 64GB RAM) and includes explicit support for defining plugins via Terraform. This granularity allows for better "right-sizing" of clusters for specific workloads (e.g., memory-heavy vs. storage-heavy).</li>
</ul>
<p>While Scaleway is the more mature platform, STACKIT's service design aligns better with enterprise engineering requirements for exact resource allocation and Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) definition, earning it a slight technical edge (+2).</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Open Standards.</strong> Both services offer managed versions of the open-source OpenSearch engine with no significant proprietary wrappers that would prevent data migration. Users can use standard tools like Logstash, Fluentd, or Data Prepper to ingest data and standard snapshot/restore APIs to migrate indices out. Neither vendor enforces a proprietary API gateway or query language extension that would create friction during an exit.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for early-stage startups due to its flexibility and lower barrier to entry. By offering a <strong>Standalone (Single-Node)</strong> configuration under its 'Cloud Essentials' line, it allows teams to start development for roughly <strong>€50-€80/month</strong> (estimated based on shared instance pricing), whereas <strong>STACKIT</strong> appears to enforce a minimum 3-node cluster architecture (Replica plans) starting at approximately <strong>€146/month</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway Cloud Essentials:</strong> Targets ease of use and affordability. The availability of <em>SEARCHDB-SHARED-2C-8G</em> instances means you only pay for the capacity you need during development. While production HA setups (3-node) would likely converge in price with STACKIT (~€150/mo), the ability to start small gives it a significant edge for lean operations.</li><li><strong>STACKIT OpenSearch:</strong> Focuses on production readiness. Its pricing for a 3-node High Availability cluster (e.g., <em>OpenSearch-1.4.10-Replica</em> at ~€0.21/hr) is actually excellent value for money compared to AWS or Azure managed equivalents. However, the lack of a visible, low-cost single-node entry point makes it overkill and expensive for a 'typical startup' just validating an MVP.</li></ul><p>For a startup, cash flow is king. Scaleway allows you to scale costs linearly with your growth, starting low. STACKIT forces a 'production-sized' step function cost from day one.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A) is noticeably superior in feature depth and innovation compared to STACKIT (Service B).</strong></p> <p>The primary differentiator is <strong>Scaleway's Serverless SQL</strong> capability. Scaleway offers a true 'next-gen' database paradigm that autoscales compute and storage to zero, drastically reducing costs for intermittent workloads (dev/test, sporadic apps). STACKIT's 'Flex' offering, despite the name, relies on traditional <strong>vertical scaling</strong> (changing 'flavors'), which requires manual intervention or external automation scripts and does not pause billing during inactivity.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Innovation & Features:</strong> Scaleway leads with built-in support for <code>pgvector</code> for AI applications and a seamless serverless experience. STACKIT provides a robust but standard 'provisioned' experience (VM + Postgres).</li> <li><strong>Reliability & Transparency:</strong> Scaleway publishes clear, accessible SLAs (99.95% HA). STACKIT's documentation emphasizes 'High Availability by Design' (3 replicas) but lacks the same level of publicly accessible, granular SLA guarantees without a login/contract, and user sentiment suggests the platform's general DX is still maturing relative to established players.</li> <li><strong>Developer Experience:</strong> User reports indicate STACKIT is still catching up in terms of platform polish ('not really usable' for advanced cloud-native patterns compared to AKS/EKS equivalents). Scaleway has a more proven track record in the developer community.</li> </ul> <p>In summary, while STACKIT is a viable choice for static enterprise workloads requiring strict German data sovereignty, it technically lags behind Scaleway's modern, automated, and feature-rich platform.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B) offers slightly better portability due to its adherence to a standard architectural model.</strong></p> <p>Both services are based on open-source PostgreSQL, ensuring high data portability. However, a nuanced difference exists:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Service A (Scaleway Serverless):</strong> To achieve 'scale-to-zero' and connection pooling, Scaleway's Serverless architecture introduces specific limitations, such as a <strong>1MB max request size</strong> and restrictions on features like <code>LISTEN/NOTIFY</code> or concurrent materialized view refreshes. Designing an application around these constraints creates a mild form of 'architectural lock-in.'</li> <li><strong>Service B (STACKIT):</strong> Uses a standard provisioned model (Primary + Replicas). Applications running here are virtually identical to those running on-premise or on EC2/Compute Engine, with no specific proxy-imposed limitations. This makes migration <em>out</em> of STACKIT slightly easier as there is no need to refactor code to handle serverless-specific quirks.</li> </ul><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Managed Database for PostgreSQL</strong> is the clear winner for early-stage startups and cost-conscious developments. Its pricing architecture allows for an exceptionally low barrier to entry, with the <em>Play</em> tier (shared vCPU) instances like 'PICO' and 'NANO' costing as little as <strong>€0.014 to €0.027 per hour</strong> (approximately €10–€20/month). This allows developers to run true managed Postgres instances for the price of a cheap VPS. For production, Scaleway's <em>Pro</em> tier offers dedicated resources at competitive rates (e.g., 2 vCPU / 8GB RAM for ~€0.11/hour).</p>
<p><strong>STACKIT PostgreSQL Flex</strong> targets a more enterprise-grade segment, heavily emphasizing stability and High Availability (HA) by default. Its primary offering is a <strong>3-node Replica set</strong>, which significantly inflates the starting cost. The smallest identified entry point for these replica sets is around <strong>€0.197/hour</strong> (~€144/month) for a 2 vCPU / 4GB RAM configuration. While single-node configurations exist, they are priced at roughly 50% of the replica set (still ~€72/month for similar specs), making them substantially more expensive than Scaleway's equivalent. STACKIT does offer cheaper storage (~€0.04/GB vs Scaleway's ~€0.10/GB), but this saving is generally eclipsed by the higher compute costs for small-to-medium workloads.</p>
<p>For a typical startup, the inability to spin up a sub-€20/month database makes STACKIT a difficult sell purely on value-for-money metrics compared to Scaleway's granular and accessible pricing.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> is the technically superior 'Cloud Platform' in this comparison. It offers the elasticity and granular control expected of a modern PaaS: you can provision a single node, dynamically attach Read Replicas later, and independently scale storage and compute. Its documentation is comprehensive, and the SLA is publicly committed.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT (Service B)</strong> operates more like a 'Managed Hosting' provider within a cloud wrapper. Its Terraform resource (<code>stackit_mariadb_instance</code>) reveals that High Availability is determined by the <em>Plan Name</em> (e.g., <code>stackit-mariadb-replica...</code>) rather than by composing resources. While this 'T-Shirt Size' approach reduces complexity for enterprise IT departments (you simply buy the 'HA Plan'), it lacks the technical flexibility of Scaleway's architecture. Furthermore, the lack of a publicly indexed SLA percentage lowers the confidence score for general-purpose developers compared to Scaleway's transparent 99.95% guarantee.</p> <p>The score of <strong>-5</strong> reflects that while STACKIT is a robust, production-ready database (especially for German sovereignty needs), it is <em>Noticeably Inferior</em> in terms of cloud-native feature depth (dynamic scaling, granular replica management) compared to Scaleway's mature GA offering.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p>Both services are managed wrappers around standard Open Source engines (MySQL for Scaleway, MariaDB for STACKIT). <strong>Score 0 (Symmetrical Standards)</strong> is applied because migrating data out of either service uses standard tools like <code>mysqldump</code> or replication streams. Neither vendor imposes proprietary data formats or restrictive APIs that would significantly increase exit costs. Scaleway integrates with its 'Cockpit' for monitoring, while STACKIT supports 'Graphite' export; these are peripheral sticky factors but do not constitute data lock-in.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the overwhelming winner for cost-efficiency, particularly for startups and small-to-medium workloads. Its pricing model is aggressively competitive, with managed MySQL instances starting as low as <strong>€0.01/hour</strong> (approx. €7/month) for the <em>DB-DEV-S</em> tier. A major differentiator is Scaleway's policy on network traffic: <strong>ingress and egress are free</strong>, which can result in massive savings for bandwidth-heavy applications compared to most other providers.</p><p><strong>StackIT</strong>, while robust and secure (focusing on German data sovereignty), targets the enterprise market with a significantly higher entry point. The smallest identifiable single-node instance (<em>MariaDB-1.4.10-Single</em>) costs approximately <strong>€0.10/hour</strong> (~€72/month), which is roughly <strong>10x more expensive</strong> than Scaleway's entry-level offering. While StackIT bundles storage (e.g., 10GB) into the hourly rate, this does not offset the stark difference in compute costs. Additionally, StackIT's billing is less flexible for smaller projects that do not require the strict compliance certifications (like C5) that drive StackIT's premium.</p><p>For a typical startup, Scaleway offers virtually identical utility for a fraction of the price, making it the clear value-for-money choice.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway (Service A) is the technically superior product for general-purpose use cases.</strong> It offers a 'battery-included' experience with a fully mature Terraform provider, a clear and functional UI for sharding (Cluster mode), and explicit Service Level Agreements. Its hard limit of 6 nodes for managed clusters is a constraint, but it is a <em>known</em> and managed constraint.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT (Service B) lags significantly in transparency and platform maturity.</strong> The investigation revealed critical documentation quality issues, such as referencing 'Galera Cluster' (a MariaDB technology) in Redis architectural overviews, which undermines trust in the technical accuracy of their docs. Furthermore, while STACKIT claims to support Redis Cluster, their public pricing and configuration options strictly list 3-node 'Replica' sets (Sentinel-style HA), suggesting that true horizontal sharding is either a manual 'contact sales' feature or poorly exposed. The 'experimental' status of basic networking resources in their Terraform provider further confirms a lower level of technical readiness.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Zero Lock-in for both services.</strong> Both Scaleway and STACKIT utilize the standard, open-source Redis protocol. There are no indications of proprietary commands, modified engines, or 'black-box' APIs that would prevent a standard <code>BGSAVE</code> export or replication-based migration. Switching costs are limited strictly to data transfer and network reconfiguration (DNS/ACLs), which is standard for any infrastructure migration.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for cost-efficiency, offering a significantly lower barrier to entry and cheaper scaling for high-availability setups. Its pricing model is built for developers and startups, with a standalone instance starting around <strong>€0.0479/hour (~€35/month)</strong>.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway Pricing:</strong> Uses a granular model where you pay for the Main Node and significantly reduced rates for Additional Nodes. For example, a 3-node High Availability (HA) cluster with 2GB RAM costs approximately <strong>€0.103/hour</strong> (~€75/month).</li><li><strong>STACKIT Pricing:</strong> Focuses on enterprise compliance and sovereignty. Its entry-level 'Replica' (3-node HA) plan starts at roughly <strong>€0.20/hour</strong> (~€146/month). This is nearly <strong>double the cost</strong> of Scaleway's equivalent cluster configuration.</li><li><strong>Value Comparison:</strong> While STACKIT offers premium German data sovereignty suitable for strictly regulated industries, Scaleway provides a comparable European cloud experience at half the price. For a typical startup workload where strict 'Sovereign Cloud' certifications are not the primary driver, Scaleway offers far superior value for money.</li></ul>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT MongoDB Flex is noticeably superior due to its support for Sharding and Point-in-Time Recovery.</strong></p> <p>While Scaleway's offering is a polished, modern implementation of a standard MongoDB Replica Set (launched as a certified product in late 2024), it currently lacks the <strong>Horizontal Scaling</strong> capabilities found in STACKIT. STACKIT's inclusion of <em>Sharded Clusters</em> makes it viable for Tier-1, massive-scale applications that exceed the write capacity of a single primary node. Scaleway is restricted to vertical scaling within a Replica Set architecture.</p> <p>Furthermore, STACKIT explicitly markets <strong>Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)</strong>, a critical enterprise compliance feature that allows restoration to a specific second. Scaleway's documentation currently emphasizes volume snapshots, which typically offer coarser RPO (Recovery Point Objective). Both services benefit from the 'Certified by MongoDB' partnership, ensuring the underlying engine is robust, but STACKIT's feature set is currently more 'Enterprise Ready' for complex data needs.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (Official Partners).</strong></p> <p>Both Scaleway and STACKIT are part of the <strong>'Certified by MongoDB'</strong> DBaaS program (announced May 2024). This is a decisive factor for lock-in: unlike proprietary wrappers (e.g., Azure CosmosDB for MongoDB) that might emulate the API, these services run official MongoDB binaries with verified compatibility. This ensures 100% compatibility with standard MongoDB drivers, tools (mongodump/mongorestore), and the wider ecosystem. Migrating out of either service is as simple as a standard mongodump or replication sync to another MongoDB instance.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Managed MongoDB®</strong> is the clear winner for cost-efficiency and value, particularly for startups and typical production workloads. It utilizes the <strong>MongoDB Community Edition</strong>, which allows Scaleway to offer robust instance sizes (e.g., 2 vCPU, 4GB RAM) at a fraction of the cost of competitors.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Entry-Level Disparity:</strong> Scaleway's 3-node HA cluster with 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM costs approximately <strong>€136/month</strong>. In stark contrast, STACKIT's comparable entry-level HA cluster (Flavor 1.1, likely 1 vCPU/1GB RAM) starts around <strong>€148/month</strong>. For a machine with similar specs to Scaleway's entry point (e.g., STACKIT Flavor 2.4), the cost jumps significantly (approx. €500+/month).</li> <li><strong>Licensing Model:</strong> STACKIT appears to position its service around the <strong>Enterprise version</strong> capabilities, which incurs a heavy premium. While valuable for large corporate entities requiring specific compliance integrations (like LDAP/Kerberos), this pricing model is hostile to typical startup budgets that do not require these features.</li> <li><strong>Development Costs:</strong> Scaleway allows for cost-effective single-node development instances starting around <strong>€78/month</strong> (for 2vCPU/4GB), whereas STACKIT's single-node instances, while having a lower absolute starting price (~€63/month), offer significantly fewer resources (1GB RAM), making them less viable for serious development work without upgrading to a much more expensive tier.</li> </ul> <p>Unless your workload strictly mandates MongoDB Enterprise Advanced features, Scaleway offers vastly superior hardware resources per euro spent.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Verdict: STACKIT Dremio is architecturally superior due to Scaleway's critical implementation limits.</strong></p><p>While ClickHouse is generally a more performant engine than Dremio for raw speed, Scaleway's managed implementation fundamentally cripples the engine's potential by forcing a <em>&quot;Replica-only&quot;</em> architecture. As confirmed in 2025 documentation, Scaleway disables manual sharding, meaning <strong>a single query cannot be parallelized across multiple nodes</strong>. This restricts the service to vertical scaling only—a fatal flaw for a product labeled &quot;Data Warehouse.&quot;</p><p>In contrast, STACKIT Dremio provides the full distributed power of the Dremio engine. It allows users to process massive datasets by fanning out execution across a cluster, handling complex JOINs and heavy transformations that would choke a single Scaleway node. Furthermore, Scaleway's service remains in <strong>Preview</strong> status (as of late 2025), whereas STACKIT's offering benefits from the stability of a direct vendor partnership. Unless the workload is strictly simple, high-concurrency reporting on small datasets, STACKIT offers a far more capable and scalable technical foundation.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Score +10: STACKIT offers an Industry-Leading Zero Lock-in model.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>STACKIT Dremio (Service B):</strong> Adopts a pure <em>Data Lakehouse</em> strategy. Your data resides in your own STACKIT Object Storage buckets in open standard formats (Apache Iceberg, Parquet). Dremio acts solely as a compute engine; if you cancel the service, your data remains untouched and immediately queryable by other engines (Trino, Spark, Snowflake) with zero migration effort.</li><li><strong>Scaleway ClickHouse (Service A):</strong> utilizes the standard database lock-in model. Data must be ingested into ClickHouse's internal format. While ClickHouse is open-source, migrating away requires a computationally expensive export (SELECT * INTO outfile) or replication process to move data back to a neutral format or another vendor.</li></ul><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Data Warehouse (ClickHouse)</strong> wins on raw price-performance for typical startup analytics. Its model is traditional and transparent: you pay for the <em>size of the instance</em> (e.g., vCPUs, RAM) and the <em>storage</em> you consume. Scaleway's pricing is aggressively low (starting around €0.12/vCPU/hour), and ClickHouse's renowned data compression (often 10x) further slashes the effective cost of storage.</p><p><strong>STACKIT Dremio</strong> operates on a different architectural premise (Data Lakehouse). Instead of paying to <em>store</em> data inside Dremio, you pay for the <em>compute</em> to query data that already sits in object storage. While this eliminates ETL costs and data duplication, the unit cost of compute (often priced per 'DCU' or similar unit) can be higher during active queries. For a startup with moderate data volumes (GBs to TBs), the overhead of managing a Data Lakehouse often exceeds the cost of simply ingesting data into a managed ClickHouse instance.</p><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Choose <strong>Scaleway</strong> for a dedicated, high-speed analytics database at a budget-friendly flat rate. Choose <strong>STACKIT Dremio</strong> only if you have massive datasets (PB scale) sitting in object storage that you cannot afford to move or duplicate.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT OpenSearch is the technically superior choice for production workloads, while Scaleway wins on Developer Experience (DX) for smaller projects.</strong></p> <p>The critical differentiator is the service tiering. Scaleway explicitly labels its service as <em>'Cloud Essentials,'</em> a classification that often excludes services from their highest SLA tiers (unlike their 'Managed Databases' for PostgreSQL). This suggests the underlying architecture is optimized for agility and cost rather than the 'five nines' reliability required by enterprise search clusters. The documentation emphasizes 'Standalone' (no redundancy) vs. 'High Availability' but lacks the depth of configuration found in enterprise competitors.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong>, conversely, approaches this as a heavy-duty infrastructure provider. Their rigorous versioning (e.g., <code>OpenSearch-2.8.10-Replica-EU01</code>) and focus on <em>'Sovereign Cloud'</em> compliance indicate a backend designed for stability and regulatory adherence. While their DX might feel less 'agile' than Scaleway's modern UI, the inclusion of automatic repairs and a focus on high-availability 'Replica' plans by default makes it the more robust technical platform for serious data indexing.</p> <p>Ultimately, Scaleway is better for a startup building a search prototype, but STACKIT is the correct architectural choice for a company requiring a guaranteed, compliant, and resilient search engine.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Standards (Score: 0):</strong> Both services manage the standard open-source OpenSearch engine. There is no significant evidence of proprietary wrappers or non-standard APIs that would prevent a user from exporting their data (via snapshots) and restoring it to another provider (e.g., AWS OpenSearch or self-hosted). Users interact with standard OpenSearch APIs in both cases, making migration costs purely operational (data transfer) rather than technical refactoring.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner for cost-conscious startups and value-driven engineering teams. Its pricing model is aggressively transparent, offering a specific <em>Cloud Essentials</em> tier that allows teams to spin up a 2 vCPU / 8GB RAM node for approximately <strong>€0.099/hour</strong> (~€72/month). Production-grade nodes (POP2) are also competitively priced at ~€0.14/hour, with clearly defined storage costs at ~€0.10/GB.</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong>, by contrast, adopts an enterprise/opaque pricing strategy. Specific costs for OpenSearch are not publicly indexed and require access to their proprietary calculator or sales contact. As a <em>Sovereign Cloud</em> provider (Schwarz Group), STACKIT typically targets compliance-heavy enterprise workloads rather than cost-optimization, likely carrying a premium over commodity providers like Scaleway. For a typical startup workload, Scaleway offers immediate visibility and lower entry costs.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Scaleway is fully public; STACKIT is opaque.</li> <li><strong>Entry Cost:</strong> Scaleway starts at ~€72/month/node; STACKIT entry is hidden but likely higher.</li> <li><strong>Value:</strong> Scaleway provides better raw price-performance for standard search workloads.</li> </ul>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Maturity & Reliability:</strong> STACKIT RabbitMQ (Service B) represents a mature, enterprise-grade implementation of a message broker. By offering explicit clustering options and adhering to standard availability expectations (High Availability), it vastly outperforms Scaleway NATS (Service A) in reliability commitments. Scaleway's SLA of <strong>99.0%</strong> is significantly below the industry standard (typically 99.9%+) for cloud messaging, and the service imposes 'hard' limits like a single set of credentials per account, which renders it unsuitable for complex multi-tenant or secure microservices architectures.</p> <p><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Service A (Scaleway) attempts to simplify operations via a serverless model, but introduces technical debt through its opacity. The inability to access the native NATS monitoring endpoint forces developers to engineer custom solutions for autoscaling logic. Service B (STACKIT) provides a transparent, standard RabbitMQ experience where existing tools, plugins, and operational playbooks apply directly without modification.</p> <p><strong>Feature Depth:</strong> While NATS is technically a 'next-gen' protocol compared to AMQP, Scaleway's implementation cripples its potential with storage quotas (referenced as low as 300MB for persistence in some contexts) and lack of granular security controls. STACKIT delivers the full breadth of RabbitMQ features, including Federation and Exchange-to-Exchange bindings, making it the noticeably superior choice for production workloads.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>API & Standards:</strong> STACKIT RabbitMQ (Service B) is a standard implementation of the open-source RabbitMQ broker. Users can migrate data in or out using standard AMQP tools (e.g., <code>rabbitmqadmin export</code>) and connect using any standard SDK. The platform imposes minimal vendor-specific constraints.</p> <p><strong>Proprietary Friction in A:</strong> Scaleway NATS (Service A) introduces higher friction due to its specific authentication architecture. It enforces the use of NKeys via a proprietary API flow and limits the account to a single identity, deviating from how self-hosted NATS clusters (which support flexible authentication schemes and multi-user accounts) typically operate. Migrating <em>away</em> from Scaleway would require refactoring application security logic to handle standard NATS authentication, and migrating <em>to</em> Scaleway often requires stripping away complex ACLs used in other environments.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway NATS</strong> offers a modern, cloud-native pricing model that is vastly superior for startups and variable workloads. It utilizes a <em>pay-per-use</em> mechanism where users are billed primarily for the volume of data transferred (approx. <strong>€0.01/GB</strong>) and data stored (approx. <strong>€0.14/GB/month</strong>). This allows a startup to run a production-grade messaging system for mere pennies per month during the early growth phase.</p><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong>, in contrast, adopts a traditional enterprise pricing strategy. Its offering appears to default to a <strong>3-node High Availability cluster</strong> (Replica plans), with the entry-level plan costing approximately <strong>€0.20/hour</strong>. This translates to a minimum monthly spend of roughly <strong>€146</strong>, regardless of whether you send one message or a million. While this model provides excellent reliability and predictability for established enterprises, it presents a significant financial barrier for smaller projects.</p><p>For a typical startup, the cost difference is effectively infinite in percentage terms (e.g., €0.05 vs €146.00). Scaleway is the clear winner for cost efficiency unless the specific features of RabbitMQ (complex routing, AMQP) are strictly required over NATS.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ (Service B) is technically superior to Scaleway Queues (Service A) for production workloads due to feature completeness and protocol adherence.</strong></p> <p>While Scaleway Queues offers an attractive serverless billing model, its technical implementation relies on a proprietary emulation of the AWS SQS standard that is currently missing critical primitives. Specifically, the lack of <code>MessageGroupId</code> support in FIFO queues renders them unable to scale consumers horizontally while maintaining order (a standard SQS capability), effectively bottlenecking throughput to a single consumer. Additionally, the absence of <code>DelaySeconds</code> removes native support for delayed retries and scheduled tasks, forcing developers to implement complex client-side workarounds.</p> <p>In contrast, STACKIT provides a genuine, fully compliant RabbitMQ cluster. This enables low-latency, persistent TCP-based messaging (AMQP) which fundamentally outperforms the HTTP polling model of Scaleway Queues in high-throughput scenarios. STACKIT supports complex routing logic (Topic/Headers exchanges) and multiple protocols (MQTT/STOMP) that Scaleway completely lacks. The only area where Scaleway leads is in 'idle cost' for sporadic workloads, but for any serious messaging architecture, STACKIT's feature parity with the industry standard makes it the robust choice.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT (Service B) offers Zero Lock-in (+10)</strong> as it provides a standard, managed RabbitMQ instance. Users can migrate their configuration and application code to any other RabbitMQ provider (AWS MQ, CloudAMQP, self-hosted) without changing a single line of logic. <strong>Scaleway (Service A)</strong> uses the <strong>SQS API</strong>, which is technically a proprietary AWS interface. While widely adopted, Scaleway's <em>partial implementation</em> creates a unique form of 'reverse lock-in': code written for Scaleway's limited feature set will run on AWS, but standard AWS SQS code (using Delays or MessageGroups) will fail on Scaleway, creating friction during migration.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Queues</strong> (A) utilizes a truly <strong>serverless, usage-based model</strong>. Users pay strictly for the volume of messages and data processed, with no idle costs. While specific per-request pricing for the SQS-compatible Queues product can be intricate (often billed by data volume, e.g., €0.01/GB, or per million messages depending on the specific protocol selected like NATS vs SQS), the cost for a typical startup workload is negligible—often costing pennies per month.</p><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong> (B) follows a <strong>provisioned, enterprise-focused model</strong>. The service appears to enforce High Availability (HA) by default, with the smallest listed plan (<code>RabbitMQ-1.2.10-Replica</code>) costing approximately <strong>€0.20/hour</strong>, or roughly <strong>€146/month</strong>. This creates a significant barrier to entry for smaller projects or development environments compared to Scaleway's scale-to-zero approach.</p><p>For a startup, Scaleway is the overwhelming winner for cost efficiency, offering a practically free entry point. STACKIT is priced for enterprise production workloads requiring guaranteed resource isolation and HA from day one, making it significantly more expensive for general-purpose use.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Comparison: Serverless SNS Clone vs. Managed RabbitMQ Cluster</strong></p>
<p>This comparison contrasts two fundamentally different architectural patterns: Scaleway's serverless abstraction ('Topics') and STACKIT's managed infrastructure ('RabbitMQ').</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature Depth &amp; Constraints:</strong> STACKIT RabbitMQ is the superior technical product for general-purpose messaging. It provides the full power of the RabbitMQ engine, allowing for complex routing logic, message persistence guarantees, and protocol interoperability (AMQP/MQTT). Scaleway Topics is severely constrained by its implementation; documentation reveals a <strong>hard limit of 50 topics</strong> per project and a strict 256KB payload limit. These constraints relegate it to simple notification/webhook duties rather than acting as a serious enterprise message bus.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Paradigm:</strong> Scaleway offers a true serverless experience (pay-per-use, no instance management), which is advantageous for sporadic workloads or simple event triggers. STACKIT requires selecting a plan (CPU/RAM) and managing a cluster, which introduces capacity planning overhead but guarantees dedicated throughput and latency performance.</li>
<li><strong>Ecosystem:</strong> Scaleway's reliance on emulating the AWS SNS API is a clever DX move for migration, but it is an <em>incomplete</em> emulation. STACKIT simply <em>is</em> RabbitMQ; any library, tool, or sidecar that works with RabbitMQ works here.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Score (+4):</strong> STACKIT receives the positive score because, despite being 'legacy' infrastructure, it delivers a complete, unbounded, and standard-compliant messaging backbone. Scaleway Topics loses significant points due to the '50 topics' quota which renders it unusable for granular microservices architectures.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT (RabbitMQ) is the clear winner for portability.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>STACKIT (+10 equivalent):</strong> Utilizes pure, open-source RabbitMQ. You can migrate data using standard <code>rabbitmqadmin</code> export/import commands. Your application code uses standard AMQP libraries (e.g., <code>amqplib</code>, <code>Pika</code>) that work with any RabbitMQ provider (AWS MQ, CloudAMQP, self-hosted). Switching costs are near zero.</li>
<li><strong>Scaleway (+2 equivalent):</strong> Uses a proprietary implementation of the AWS SNS API. While this allows you to theoretically migrate <em>to</em> AWS SNS easily, migrating <em>away</em> to a non-AWS provider (like Azure Service Bus or Google Pub/Sub) requires rewriting your API calls. Furthermore, you are locked into the specific subset of the SNS API that Scaleway implements, potentially creating friction if you rely on quirky behaviors of their emulation.</li>
</ul><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Topics</strong> (part of their Messaging & Queuing product) utilizes a highly efficient <strong>usage-based (serverless)</strong> model. You pay strictly for the volume of messages and data storage used, with a free tier allowing for cost-free prototyping. This model is exceptionally <strong>startup-friendly</strong>, as costs scale linearly with growth from zero.</p><p><strong>STACKIT RabbitMQ</strong>, conversely, employs a <strong>provisioned model</strong> where you rent dedicated instances. Their standard offering appears to focus on <strong>High Availability (Replica)</strong> plans, which start at approximately <strong>€146/month</strong> (for a 3-node cluster). While this provides enterprise-grade reliability and predictability for heavy workloads, the high barrier to entry makes it significantly more expensive for typical startup workloads compared to Scaleway's pennies-per-month costs for similar initial traffic.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Critical Maturity Gap:</strong> The comparison reveals a stark difference in lifecycle status. Scaleway IAM (Service A) is a mature, feature-rich identity platform comparable to AWS IAM or Google Cloud IAM, offering <strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</strong> via Common Expression Language (CEL). This allows for sophisticated security postures, such as restricting access based on IP ranges or time windows.</p> <p>In contrast, STACKIT IAM (Service B) is currently in a transitional state. As of early 2026, its Terraform provider explicitly tags IAM functionality as <strong>&quot;Experimental&quot;</strong> and warns that the <em>&quot;underlying IAM API is expected to undergo a redesign.&quot;</em> This is a significant technical debt flag for any production architecture, as breaking changes are anticipated. Furthermore, STACKIT relies solely on a flat <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> model, lacking the conditional logic and granularity required for modern zero-trust architectures.</p> <p>While STACKIT covers the basics (Users, Service Accounts, OIDC Federation), the lack of stability in its automation layer and the absence of granular policy conditions make it noticeably inferior for complex technical requirements.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Proprietary vs. Open Standard Components:</strong> Scaleway leverages <strong>Common Expression Language (CEL)</strong> for its policy conditions. While the policy structure itself is specific to Scaleway, CEL is an open standard (CNCF) used by Google Cloud and Kubernetes, reducing the cognitive load and making logic portable. STACKIT uses a proprietary, opaque RBAC API that is currently unstable.</p> <p><strong>Migration Risk:</strong> Both services support standard <strong>OIDC Federation</strong>, allowing you to externalize identity management (e.g., to Keycloak or Entra ID), which keeps the lock-in score relatively low for both. However, Service B (STACKIT) receives a negative score because its API is currently marked as experimental/redesign-pending. Writing migration scripts against an API that is explicitly slated for breaking changes increases the 'exit cost' risk compared to Scaleway's stable, documented endpoints.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Parity in Core Access Management:</strong> Both Scaleway and StackIT follow the industry standard where Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a foundational, non-billable service. Providers do not charge for the creation of users, roles, policies, or service accounts, as these are essential for consuming paid resources (compute, storage, etc.).</p> <ul> <li><strong>Scaleway IAM:</strong> Explicitly free, but operates with <strong>soft quotas</strong> that are relevant for scaling startups. The default limits are set to 50 users, 50 groups, and 100 applications per organization. While these can be increased by contacting support, they represent a bureaucratic step that does not exist in many other cloud environments. Scaleway also offers a paid Marketplace add-on, 'Cloud-IAM' (managed Keycloak), for developers building authentication <em>into</em> their apps, but this is distinct from platform access.</li> <li><strong>StackIT IAM:</strong> Also free and included. StackIT positions itself as an enterprise-sovereign cloud (Schwarz Group), and its IAM is designed to handle organizational complexity without visible per-user billing or low default caps. It uses a standard Project/Resource hierarchy with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) that integrates with its Identity Provider (IdP).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> For a typical startup, the cost difference is <strong>zero</strong>. Scaleway's 50-user limit is the only friction point, potentially requiring a support ticket as the team grows, whereas StackIT's model appears more permeable for larger teams from day one. However, purely on a monetary basis, neither charges a fee.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p>Both services offer excellent stability and feature sets for storing sensitive configuration data, but they approach the problem from different paradigms, resulting in a <strong>Technical Parity (0)</strong> score where the 'better' choice depends entirely on the user's architectural preference.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway (The Cloud-Native Approach):</strong> Scaleway's offering is a classic, polished cloud secret manager comparable to AWS Secrets Manager or Google Secret Manager. It excels in <strong>Developer Experience (DX)</strong> for teams already in the Scaleway ecosystem. Its tight integration with Scaleway IAM means you don't have to manage separate authentication methods; your instance's identity simply <em>has access</em>. The 99.50% SLA and features like 'Secret Protection' (soft delete) demonstrate high maturity.</li><li><strong>STACKIT (The Open-Standard Approach):</strong> STACKIT effectively offers 'Managed HashiCorp Vault (KV Engine)'. This is technically superior for teams that value <strong>Standards</strong> over platform integration. Because it speaks the Vault protocol, it allows for advanced workflows using the standard Vault CLI and ecosystem tools. However, as a managed service, it appears restricted primarily to the Key-Value engine, lacking the full flexibility of a self-hosted Vault (like dynamic secrets for databases or PKI engines), which prevents it from scoring higher.</li><li><strong>Trade-off:</strong> Choose Scaleway for simplicity and 'set-and-forget' cloud integration. Choose STACKIT if you want to use the industry-standard Vault protocol without the operational overhead of managing a Vault cluster.</li></ul><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT achieves a perfect 'Zero Lock-in' score (+10)</strong> because it utilizes the open-source <strong>HashiCorp Vault API</strong>. A developer can point their application to a local Vault instance, an HCP Vault, or a self-hosted cluster with minimal code changes—often just changing the `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable. There is no proprietary wrapper that binds you to STACKIT.</p><p><strong>Scaleway</strong>, conversely, uses a <strong>Proprietary API (-5)</strong>. While it is a high-quality API with Terraform support, migrating away would require rewriting application logic or using an abstraction layer (like External Secrets Operator) to translate the Scaleway-specific calls to a new provider. The data is portable, but the interface is not.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Secret Manager</strong> utilizes a highly granular, serverless-style pricing model ideal for startups and lean workloads. Users pay strictly for what they use: <strong>€0.04 per secret version per month</strong> and <strong>€0.03 per 10,000 API calls</strong>. There are no minimum fees, and secrets scheduled for deletion are free, encouraging good hygiene without cost penalties.</p>

<p><strong>STACKIT Secrets Manager</strong>, while competitive compared to hyperscalers like AWS ($0.40/secret), is generally more expensive than Scaleway. Its pricing is approximately <strong>€0.10 per secret per month</strong> (billed as ~€0.00014/hour). Crucially, STACKIT documentation indicates a <strong>minimum purchase quantity</strong> (typically 50 secrets per service instance), establishing a minimum monthly spend of roughly €5.00 regardless of usage. While STACKIT offers lower unit rates for massive scale (e.g., 100k+ secrets drop to ~€0.035/secret), this volume is irrelevant for most startups.</p>

<p>For a typical startup with 50 secrets and moderate access patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scaleway:</strong> ~€2.00/month (50 secrets * €0.04).</li>
<li><strong>STACKIT:</strong> ~€5.00/month (Minimum commitment / 50 secrets * €0.10).</li>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT KMS is noticeably superior in current infrastructure integration capabilities.</strong> While Scaleway is a more mature platform overall, its Key Manager service suffers from a significant documented gap: the lack of native Server-Side Encryption with KMS (SSE-KMS) for Object Storage, which is explicitly roadmap-bound for Q2 2026. In contrast, STACKIT KMS is already integrated with critical infrastructure components like Block Storage, allowing users to provision encrypted volumes referencing managed keys directly in Terraform.</p><p>Scaleway excels in <em>application-layer</em> encryption (via Secret Manager and ephemeral API operations), but for a Cloud Architect prioritizing &quot;managed persistence encryption,&quot; STACKIT's ability to handle volume encryption natively without client-side key management friction gives it the technical lead.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Proprietary Lock-in.</strong> Both services utilize proprietary REST APIs for key management and cryptographic operations, with no native support for open standards like KMIP or PKCS#11 exposed to the end-user. Migration from either service would require re-encrypting data (envelope encryption rotation) or exporting keys (if permitted by policy, though typically restricted).

While most providers (including AWS and likely STACKIT) charge approximately <strong>$1.00/€1.00 per key/month</strong>, Scaleway charges just <strong>€0.04 per key version/month</strong>.

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p>The comparison highlights a fundamental gap between a <strong>mature governance product</strong> (Scaleway) and an <strong>emerging infrastructure utility</strong> (STACKIT). Scaleway Audit Trail receives a higher technical score primarily due to its <strong>GA maturity</strong> and reliability for its core purpose: compliance.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Maturity & Stability:</strong> Scaleway Audit Trail is a polished, production-ready service. Users can rely on it today for forensic timelines and compliance audits (GDPR, HDS). STACKIT Telemetry Router is explicitly marked as <code>v1alpha</code> in 2026 documentation. In enterprise contexts, an Alpha service for audit logging is a critical risk, rendering it significantly inferior for immediate production use despite its modern architecture.</li> <li><strong>Architecture & UX:</strong> Scaleway prioritizes <em>Simplicity</em>. It captures events automatically and offers a 'set-and-forget' export to Object Storage. STACKIT prioritizes <em>Flexibility</em>. By treating audit logs as 'telemetry streams' routable via OpenTelemetry, STACKIT offers a more powerful forward-looking architecture. However, this requires more configuration and assumes the user wants to build a pipeline rather than just 'have audit logs'.</li> <li><strong>Feature Depth:</strong> Scaleway's integration with 'Cockpit' allows for immediate visualization of audit data alongside application metrics. STACKIT's router is a transport mechanism; it relies on external systems (or STACKIT Observability) to provide value from the data.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Scaleway wins on 'Hard Specs' (Stability/Maturity) for the requested timeframe. STACKIT's offering is technically promising but currently too immature (Alpha) to compete on parity.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT Telemetry Router (Score: +5)</strong> utilizes <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> (OTel), the industry standard for observability. This means data flowing through the router is structured in a vendor-neutral format, allowing users to switch backends (e.g., from STACKIT Observability to a self-hosted Jaeger/Loki stack) with near-zero friction. <strong>Scaleway Audit Trail (Score: 0)</strong> exports data in a <strong>proprietary JSON schema</strong>. While this is not 'high lock-in' (JSON is universal and S3 exports are portable), it requires custom parsing logic to migrate or ingest into third-party SIEMs, whereas STACKIT's OTel stream is instantly compatible with the broader ecosystem.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Audit Trail</strong> is significantly more cost-effective as it is offered as a <strong>free, built-in feature</strong> of the Scaleway platform. It automatically records API, user, and resource actions without any configuration or hourly cost. Users only incur costs if they choose to export logs to Object Storage (paying only for the storage used).</p><p><strong>STACKIT Telemetry Router</strong>, by contrast, is a provisioned component designed to handle and route audit streams. While it offers centralized control for routing telemetry, it follows STACKIT's standard <strong>pay-as-you-go</strong> model (typically based on hourly usage or data throughput). Unlike Scaleway's solution, which is 'always on' for free, the Telemetry Router is an infrastructure resource that likely incurs a running cost.</p><p>For a typical startup wanting basic audit visibility, Scaleway provides immediate value at <strong>$0</strong>, whereas STACKIT requires deploying a specific service to manage these streams, making it the more expensive option for this specific function.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Critical Maturity Gap:</strong> The comparison reveals a stark difference in lifecycle status. Scaleway IAM (Service A) is a mature, feature-rich identity platform comparable to AWS IAM or Google Cloud IAM, offering <strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)</strong> via Common Expression Language (CEL). This allows for sophisticated security postures, such as restricting access based on IP ranges or time windows.</p> <p>In contrast, STACKIT IAM (Service B) is currently in a transitional state. As of early 2026, its Terraform provider explicitly tags IAM functionality as <strong>&quot;Experimental&quot;</strong> and warns that the <em>&quot;underlying IAM API is expected to undergo a redesign.&quot;</em> This is a significant technical debt flag for any production architecture, as breaking changes are anticipated. Furthermore, STACKIT relies solely on a flat <strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</strong> model, lacking the conditional logic and granularity required for modern zero-trust architectures.</p> <p>While STACKIT covers the basics (Users, Service Accounts, OIDC Federation), the lack of stability in its automation layer and the absence of granular policy conditions make it noticeably inferior for complex technical requirements.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Proprietary vs. Open Standard Components:</strong> Scaleway leverages <strong>Common Expression Language (CEL)</strong> for its policy conditions. While the policy structure itself is specific to Scaleway, CEL is an open standard (CNCF) used by Google Cloud and Kubernetes, reducing the cognitive load and making logic portable. STACKIT uses a proprietary, opaque RBAC API that is currently unstable.</p> <p><strong>Migration Risk:</strong> Both services support standard <strong>OIDC Federation</strong>, allowing you to externalize identity management (e.g., to Keycloak or Entra ID), which keeps the lock-in score relatively low for both. However, Service B (STACKIT) receives a negative score because its API is currently marked as experimental/redesign-pending. Writing migration scripts against an API that is explicitly slated for breaking changes increases the 'exit cost' risk compared to Scaleway's stable, documented endpoints.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Parity in Core Access Management:</strong> Both Scaleway and StackIT follow the industry standard where Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a foundational, non-billable service. Providers do not charge for the creation of users, roles, policies, or service accounts, as these are essential for consuming paid resources (compute, storage, etc.).</p> <ul> <li><strong>Scaleway IAM:</strong> Explicitly free, but operates with <strong>soft quotas</strong> that are relevant for scaling startups. The default limits are set to 50 users, 50 groups, and 100 applications per organization. While these can be increased by contacting support, they represent a bureaucratic step that does not exist in many other cloud environments. Scaleway also offers a paid Marketplace add-on, 'Cloud-IAM' (managed Keycloak), for developers building authentication <em>into</em> their apps, but this is distinct from platform access.</li> <li><strong>StackIT IAM:</strong> Also free and included. StackIT positions itself as an enterprise-sovereign cloud (Schwarz Group), and its IAM is designed to handle organizational complexity without visible per-user billing or low default caps. It uses a standard Project/Resource hierarchy with RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) that integrates with its Identity Provider (IdP).</li> </ul> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> For a typical startup, the cost difference is <strong>zero</strong>. Scaleway's 50-user limit is the only friction point, potentially requiring a support ticket as the team grows, whereas StackIT's model appears more permeable for larger teams from day one. However, purely on a monetary basis, neither charges a fee.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p>Both services offer excellent stability and feature sets for storing sensitive configuration data, but they approach the problem from different paradigms, resulting in a <strong>Technical Parity (0)</strong> score where the 'better' choice depends entirely on the user's architectural preference.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway (The Cloud-Native Approach):</strong> Scaleway's offering is a classic, polished cloud secret manager comparable to AWS Secrets Manager or Google Secret Manager. It excels in <strong>Developer Experience (DX)</strong> for teams already in the Scaleway ecosystem. Its tight integration with Scaleway IAM means you don't have to manage separate authentication methods; your instance's identity simply <em>has access</em>. The 99.50% SLA and features like 'Secret Protection' (soft delete) demonstrate high maturity.</li><li><strong>STACKIT (The Open-Standard Approach):</strong> STACKIT effectively offers 'Managed HashiCorp Vault (KV Engine)'. This is technically superior for teams that value <strong>Standards</strong> over platform integration. Because it speaks the Vault protocol, it allows for advanced workflows using the standard Vault CLI and ecosystem tools. However, as a managed service, it appears restricted primarily to the Key-Value engine, lacking the full flexibility of a self-hosted Vault (like dynamic secrets for databases or PKI engines), which prevents it from scoring higher.</li><li><strong>Trade-off:</strong> Choose Scaleway for simplicity and 'set-and-forget' cloud integration. Choose STACKIT if you want to use the industry-standard Vault protocol without the operational overhead of managing a Vault cluster.</li></ul><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT achieves a perfect 'Zero Lock-in' score (+10)</strong> because it utilizes the open-source <strong>HashiCorp Vault API</strong>. A developer can point their application to a local Vault instance, an HCP Vault, or a self-hosted cluster with minimal code changes—often just changing the `VAULT_ADDR` environment variable. There is no proprietary wrapper that binds you to STACKIT.</p><p><strong>Scaleway</strong>, conversely, uses a <strong>Proprietary API (-5)</strong>. While it is a high-quality API with Terraform support, migrating away would require rewriting application logic or using an abstraction layer (like External Secrets Operator) to translate the Scaleway-specific calls to a new provider. The data is portable, but the interface is not.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Secret Manager</strong> utilizes a highly granular, serverless-style pricing model ideal for startups and lean workloads. Users pay strictly for what they use: <strong>€0.04 per secret version per month</strong> and <strong>€0.03 per 10,000 API calls</strong>. There are no minimum fees, and secrets scheduled for deletion are free, encouraging good hygiene without cost penalties.</p>

<p><strong>STACKIT Secrets Manager</strong>, while competitive compared to hyperscalers like AWS ($0.40/secret), is generally more expensive than Scaleway. Its pricing is approximately <strong>€0.10 per secret per month</strong> (billed as ~€0.00014/hour). Crucially, STACKIT documentation indicates a <strong>minimum purchase quantity</strong> (typically 50 secrets per service instance), establishing a minimum monthly spend of roughly €5.00 regardless of usage. While STACKIT offers lower unit rates for massive scale (e.g., 100k+ secrets drop to ~€0.035/secret), this volume is irrelevant for most startups.</p>

<p>For a typical startup with 50 secrets and moderate access patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scaleway:</strong> ~€2.00/month (50 secrets * €0.04).</li>
<li><strong>STACKIT:</strong> ~€5.00/month (Minimum commitment / 50 secrets * €0.10).</li>
</ul>

<p>Scaleway is the clear winner for cost efficiency due to its lack of minimums and lower base unit price.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p>The comparison highlights a fundamental gap between a <strong>mature governance product</strong> (Scaleway) and an <strong>emerging infrastructure utility</strong> (STACKIT). Scaleway Audit Trail receives a higher technical score primarily due to its <strong>GA maturity</strong> and reliability for its core purpose: compliance.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Maturity & Stability:</strong> Scaleway Audit Trail is a polished, production-ready service. Users can rely on it today for forensic timelines and compliance audits (GDPR, HDS). STACKIT Telemetry Router is explicitly marked as <code>v1alpha</code> in 2026 documentation. In enterprise contexts, an Alpha service for audit logging is a critical risk, rendering it significantly inferior for immediate production use despite its modern architecture.</li> <li><strong>Architecture & UX:</strong> Scaleway prioritizes <em>Simplicity</em>. It captures events automatically and offers a 'set-and-forget' export to Object Storage. STACKIT prioritizes <em>Flexibility</em>. By treating audit logs as 'telemetry streams' routable via OpenTelemetry, STACKIT offers a more powerful forward-looking architecture. However, this requires more configuration and assumes the user wants to build a pipeline rather than just 'have audit logs'.</li> <li><strong>Feature Depth:</strong> Scaleway's integration with 'Cockpit' allows for immediate visualization of audit data alongside application metrics. STACKIT's router is a transport mechanism; it relies on external systems (or STACKIT Observability) to provide value from the data.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Scaleway wins on 'Hard Specs' (Stability/Maturity) for the requested timeframe. STACKIT's offering is technically promising but currently too immature (Alpha) to compete on parity.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT Telemetry Router (Score: +5)</strong> utilizes <strong>OpenTelemetry</strong> (OTel), the industry standard for observability. This means data flowing through the router is structured in a vendor-neutral format, allowing users to switch backends (e.g., from STACKIT Observability to a self-hosted Jaeger/Loki stack) with near-zero friction. <strong>Scaleway Audit Trail (Score: 0)</strong> exports data in a <strong>proprietary JSON schema</strong>. While this is not 'high lock-in' (JSON is universal and S3 exports are portable), it requires custom parsing logic to migrate or ingest into third-party SIEMs, whereas STACKIT's OTel stream is instantly compatible with the broader ecosystem.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Audit Trail</strong> is significantly more cost-effective as it is offered as a <strong>free, built-in feature</strong> of the Scaleway platform. It automatically records API, user, and resource actions without any configuration or hourly cost. Users only incur costs if they choose to export logs to Object Storage (paying only for the storage used).</p><p><strong>STACKIT Telemetry Router</strong>, by contrast, is a provisioned component designed to handle and route audit streams. While it offers centralized control for routing telemetry, it follows STACKIT's standard <strong>pay-as-you-go</strong> model (typically based on hourly usage or data throughput). Unlike Scaleway's solution, which is 'always on' for free, the Telemetry Router is an infrastructure resource that likely incurs a running cost.</p><p>For a typical startup wanting basic audit visibility, Scaleway provides immediate value at <strong>$0</strong>, whereas STACKIT requires deploying a specific service to manage these streams, making it the more expensive option for this specific function.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Cost Manager (Service A)</strong> is significantly more mature than <strong>STACKIT Cost Management (Service B)</strong>. Scaleway offers a polished, dedicated product experience with the <em>Cost Manager</em> tool, featuring deep historical data (5 years), rich visualizations (consumption graphs, pie charts), and robust automation capabilities like native billing webhooks. This allows for sophisticated, event-driven FinOps workflows (e.g., auto-scaling down resources upon budget breach).</p> <p><strong>STACKIT</strong>, conversely, is in a state of 'functional capability' rather than 'product maturity.' While it offers raw data access via its <em>Cost API v3</em> and <em>Invoice Exporter API</em>, the developer experience is hampered by API churn (deprecation of the Billing Account API in 2025) and a reliance on basic tabular views over interactive dashboards. The scheduled release of a visual dashboard in 2025 indicates they are playing catch-up. Furthermore, STACKIT's Terraform support for billing resources includes beta warnings, whereas Scaleway's is stable.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p>Both services rely on proprietary APIs for cost data retrieval, meaning neither offers zero lock-in (unlike a standardized FOCUS export). However, <strong>STACKIT</strong> introduces higher friction due to active API instability; the forced migration from 'Billing Account API' to 'Invoice Exporter API' in 2025 imposes an operational burden and code refactoring cost on users. <strong>Scaleway</strong> provides a stable, well-documented API that has not undergone such disruptive changes recently, making it slightly less burdensome to integrate with third-party tools.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Summary:</strong> Both Scaleway Cost Manager and STACKIT Cost Management are native, platform-integrated tools provided at <strong>no additional cost</strong> to customers. They function as essential utilities for financial transparency rather than paid SaaS products.</p><ul><li><strong>Scaleway Cost Manager:</strong> Explicitly marketed as a free feature, it distinguishes itself by offering a robust <strong>5-year data retention</strong> policy and a free <strong>Billing API</strong>. This allows for long-term trend analysis and programmatic export of billing data without incurring extra fees. The model is purely &quot;Included,&quot; ensuring that even small startups have full visibility into their spend.</li><li><strong>STACKIT Cost Management:</strong> Integrated directly into the STACKIT Portal, this tool focuses on real-time transparency and simplicity. It follows the platform's &quot;no hidden costs&quot; philosophy, providing live tracking of active and inactive services. While it may not advertise the same historical depth as Scaleway, it is equally cost-effective (free) and designed to prevent billing surprises.</li></ul><p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Since both tools are free inclusions of their respective cloud platforms, there is no direct cost difference. Scaleway offers slightly higher <em>value</em> for zero cost due to the extended history and API access, but strictly speaking, the pricing score is at parity (0).</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>Maturity & Transparency Gap:</strong> Scaleway Edge Services (Service A) benefits significantly from its longer time in the market (GA Nov 2024 vs. Dec 2025). This maturity manifests in clear documentation, known limitations (e.g., CNAME restrictions), and a published SLA of 99.5%. While 99.5% is below the industry standard of 99.9% for CDNs, it provides a hard engineering baseline that STACKIT (Service B) currently lacks in its public documentation.</p> <p><strong>Feature Set & Architecture:</strong> Service A operates as a 'feature toggle' for its underlying compute/storage resources, making it excellent for simple acceleration but less capable as a standalone edge platform. Service B enters the market with a strong 'Sovereign Cloud' value proposition, specifically the ability to granularly select distribution regions. This allows European enterprises to use a CDN without inadvertently caching data in non-compliant jurisdictions—a feature A lacks in such explicit detail. However, B's lack of public technical specifications regarding its backend (e.g., PoP count, specific cache purge times) and its 'trust us' approach to reliability metrics result in a lower technical score.</p> <p><strong>Trade-offs:</strong> Choose A for a predictable, integrated experience within the Scaleway ecosystem where a 99.5% availability target is acceptable. Choose B only if data sovereignty requirements mandate strict geofencing of cache nodes, accepting the risks associated with a newly launched service with opaque reliability guarantees.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>Symmetrical Open Standards:</strong> Both services operate as standard HTTP/HTTPS caching layers. Switching between them (or to a third party like Cloudflare/Fastly) primarily involves updating DNS records and re-uploading SSL certificates (if not using managed Let's Encrypt). Neither service imposes proprietary edge logic formats (like AWS Lambda@Edge or Cloudflare Workers) that would require code refactoring to migrate. The friction is exclusively administrative (DNS/Config) rather than architectural.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway</strong> offers a highly aggressive and cost-efficient pricing model for its Edge Services (CDN). By bundling cache and egress into low-cost monthly subscriptions, they achieve an effective price point of approximately <strong>€0.01 per GB</strong> (e.g., €0.99 for 100GB). Even their overage fee of <strong>€0.0135/GB</strong> is remarkably lower than the industry average.</p><p><strong>STACKIT</strong> follows a traditional consumption-based model. While their exact per-GB pricing is somewhat opaque in public marketing, technical price lists indicate a rate of approximately <strong>€0.05 per GB</strong> (derived from €0.00005/MB) for traffic in Europe and North America. This is roughly <strong>4x to 5x more expensive</strong> than Scaleway's offering for standard workloads.</p><p>For a typical startup, Scaleway's <strong>Starter plan (€0.99/mo)</strong> covers a substantial amount of traffic (100GB) that would cost roughly €5.00 on STACKIT. Scaleway's approach effectively eliminates 'bill shock' for egress, making it the superior value choice.</p>

                                    <h4>Technical Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT CDN (Service B) is rated +5 (Noticeably Superior) relative to Scaleway Edge Services (Service A).</strong></p><p>The primary technical differentiator is the <em>scope of service</em>. Scaleway Edge Services is architected as an <strong>infrastructure attachment</strong>—it is a feature you enable <em>on</em> a Scaleway Load Balancer or Bucket. It does not function as a general-purpose CDN for external origins (e.g., on-premise servers or multi-cloud backends), severely limiting its versatility for hybrid architectures.</p><p>In contrast, STACKIT CDN is positioned as a <strong>standalone network product</strong> designed to distribute 'every server' globally. While STACKIT's tooling (Terraform/CLI) is less mature due to its late-2025 GA status, the underlying capability to act as a true, origin-agnostic Content Delivery Network gives it a decisive architectural advantage over Scaleway's closed-loop optimization tool.</p><p>Furthermore, Scaleway explicitly confirms <strong>no native integration</strong> between its Edge Services and Serverless Functions, forcing developers to manage complex regional-to-edge wiring manually. STACKIT's focus on 'massive distribution' and sovereignty features (Geo-fencing) aligns better with enterprise CDN requirements, whereas Scaleway's offering is optimized strictly for accelerating its own regional resources.</p><h4>Lock-in Analysis</h4><p><strong>STACKIT CDN (Service B) has a Lower Lock-in (+5) compared to Scaleway (Service A).</strong></p><p>Scaleway Edge Services imposes <strong>High Proprietary Lock-in</strong> because it acts as a wrapper around Scaleway's specific infrastructure components (Object Storage and Load Balancers). You cannot easily point Scaleway Edge Services to a third-party origin; moving away requires ripping out both the CDN layer and the underlying storage/compute.</p><p>STACKIT CDN, functioning as a standard reverse-proxy CDN, adheres to the industry-standard architecture where the CDN is loosely coupled to the origin via DNS/CNAME. This allows users to switch CDN providers (e.g., to Cloudflare or Akamai) without necessarily migrating their backend infrastructure, significantly reducing exit costs.</p><h4>Pricing Analysis</h4><p><strong>Scaleway Edge Services</strong> offers a highly aggressive pricing model tailored for cost-efficiency. Its subscription-based approach starts at just <strong>€0.99/month</strong> for 100GB of cache egress, which effectively works out to <strong>~€0.01/GB</strong>. Even the overage rate is very low at <strong>€0.0135/GB</strong>. This makes it one of the most affordable options in the market, competing with budget CDNs like BunnyCDN while offering integrated cloud features.</p><p><strong>STACKIT CDN</strong>, consistent with its enterprise positioning, utilizes a standard Pay-As-You-Go model. While specific per-GB rates are dynamically calculated, enterprise European cloud providers typically charge in the range of <strong>€0.05 - €0.09 per GB</strong> (inferred from standard regional pricing structures and snippet data suggesting billing resolution per MB). Without a bundled 'starter' allowance, a startup with moderate traffic (e.g., 500GB) would likely pay significantly more on STACKIT than the flat €12.99 Professional plan on Scaleway (which covers 1TB).</p><p>For a typical startup workload, <strong>Scaleway</strong> is the clear winner on value, offering near-unbeatable bandwidth rates and a predictable billing structure.</p>
