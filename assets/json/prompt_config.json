If both services utilize the same open-source engine (e.g., Loki/Grafana) or both are euivalent, the Lock-in score *MUST* be 0 unless a specific proprietary wrapper exists.\n\n### Scoring Rubric (Service B relative to Service A):\nAll scores must represent the GAP between the two services and be an integer between -10 and 10.\n\n**Technical Score Examples:**\n- -10: Critically Flawed (Service B is Alpha/Beta; Service A is mature GA).\n- -5: Noticeably Inferior (B lacks essential features like cross-region sync or native CLI available in A).\n- 0: Technical Parity (No meaningful difference in features or stability).\n- +5: Noticeably Superior (B offers advanced automation/optimizations that A lacks).\n- +10: Industry Leading (B is a next-gen serverless paradigm; A is legacy provisioned).\n\n**Vendor Lock-in Score  Examples:**\n- -10: High Proprietary Lock-in (B is a closed-wall API; A is based on Open Standards).\n- -5: Higher Friction (B requires non-standard SDKs that increase exit costs compared to A).\n- 0: Symmetrical Standards (Both use the same open engine, e.g., Prometheus/LGTM stack or an equivalent of that).\n- +5: Better Portability (B provides native 'migration tools' or 'compatibility layers' better than A).\n- +10: Zero Lock-in (B is a pure managed OSS drop-in; switching costs are near zero).\n\n### Output Format:\nReturn strict JSON.

The CSP fully meets all criteria of the control. For example, it is headquartered in the EU, majority-owned by EU entities, and provides full technical/legal guarantees.\n- 8: High Compliance. Meets all major criteria with only minor, documented exceptions that do not compromise the core principle.\n- 5: Substantial Compliance. Meets the main intent of the control, but some secondary requirements (e.g., transparency level) are not fully realized.\n- 2: Partial Compliance. Some aspects are met, but there are significant areas where the CSP falls short of the full SOV requirement.\n- 0: Neutral / Indeterminate. The CSP does not make specific claims regarding this control, or there is insufficient public information to verify compliance.\n- -2: Minor Non-Compliance. There are documented practices or dependencies that slightly conflict with the control's objectives.\n- -5: Significant Non-Compliance. The CSP's structure or operations have major gaps relative to the control (e.g., heavy reliance on non-EU sub-processors for core tasks).\n- -8: High Non-Compliance. The CSP clearly fails the control's core requirements, with only minimal mitigating factors.\n- -10: Absolute Non-Compliance. The CSP's baseline state is in direct opposition to the control (e.g., subject to extraterritorial laws like FISA without any technical barriers against data access).\n\nOutput a strict JSON object.",
