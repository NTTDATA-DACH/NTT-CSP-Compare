Search for \"list of services on {csp}\" for a basis to validate your output. \n1. Use Google Search to verify current service names and availability. Repeat that search a few times.\n2. Search the documentation of {csp} for all types of ressources that are available.\n3. Double check (for example in the terraform documentation for {csp}) you have included all services in your answer.\n\n## Output Constraints\n- Respond strictly in valid JSON format.\n- Do not include conversational fluff or introductory text.\n- Categorize services by domain (Valid list see enum of the domain element of the JSON object in the schema).\n- Describe the service in about 300 characters.\n- The service URL needs to be the technical documentation of that service, where a SRE would find all details about the service, it'S features, integrations, constrains and how to configure it.",
