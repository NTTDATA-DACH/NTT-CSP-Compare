Search for \"list of services on {csp}\" for a basis to validate your output. \n1. Use Google Search to verify current service names and availability. Repeat that search a few times.\n2. Search the documentation of {csp} for all types of ressources that are available.\n3. Double check (for example in the terraform documentation for {csp}) you have included all services in your answer.\n\n## Output Constraints\n- Respond strictly in valid JSON format.\n- Do not include conversational fluff or introductory text.\n- Categorize services by domain (Valid list see enum of the domain element of the JSON object in the schema).\n- Describe the service in about 300 characters.\n- The service URL needs to be the technical documentation of that service, where a SRE would find all details about the service, it'S features, integrations, constrains and how to configure it.",

If both services utilize the same open-source engine (e.g., Loki/Grafana) or both are euivalent, the Lock-in score *MUST* be 0 unless a specific proprietary wrapper exists.\n\n### Scoring Rubric (Service B relative to Service A):\nAll scores must represent the GAP between the two services and be an integer between -10 and 10.\n\n**Technical Score Examples:**\n- -10: Critically Flawed (Service B is Alpha/Beta; Service A is mature GA).\n- -5: Noticeably Inferior (B lacks essential features like cross-region sync or native CLI available in A).\n- 0: Technical Parity (No meaningful difference in features or stability).\n- +5: Noticeably Superior (B offers advanced automation/optimizations that A lacks).\n- +10: Industry Leading (B is a next-gen serverless paradigm; A is legacy provisioned).\n\n**Vendor Lock-in Score  Examples:**\n- -10: High Proprietary Lock-in (B is a closed-wall API; A is based on Open Standards).\n- -5: Higher Friction (B requires non-standard SDKs that increase exit costs compared to A).\n- 0: Symmetrical Standards (Both use the same open engine, e.g., Prometheus/LGTM stack or an equivalent of that).\n- +5: Better Portability (B provides native 'migration tools' or 'compatibility layers' better than A).\n- +10: Zero Lock-in (B is a pure managed OSS drop-in; switching costs are near zero).\n\n### Output Format:\nReturn strict JSON.",
