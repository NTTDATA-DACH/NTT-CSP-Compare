Go through every single service category for {csp_a} (Compute, Storage, Databases, Networking, AI/ML, Security, Management & Governance, etc.) one by one and list all services within that category. Do not skip any services. It is critical that the list for {csp_a} is 100% complete. DO NOT provide a truncated or incomplete list. For every single service in {csp_a}, find the direct equivalent in {csp_b}. If no direct equivalent exists, you may leave the fields for the second CSP blank.
